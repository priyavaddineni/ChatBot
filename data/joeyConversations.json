I gotta say,    I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!\n": "Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on \"Days\"    I had to say \"Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy\".\n", "Wow. What does that mean?\n": "No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I    guess it means \"you're gonna get eaten by a bear\".\n", "Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?\n": "Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish    of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .\n", "Nah ah! Nah ah!  No no no!

So, you know, it's either her or me.\n": "Then, uh, then I'm sorry.\n", " You know...  You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.\n": "I know...\nI don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.\n", "Really?\n": "Yeah! Come on.\n", "Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.\n": "Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.\n", "I think it's a great idea.

It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!\n": "It does?\n", "Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.\n": "Really? She... she loves me?\n", "Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .\n": "Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... .

It\u2019s actually uh, a little dull.\n": "It\u2019s no Ukrainian film.\n", "A date?! She\u2019s-she\u2019s got a date?! With who?\n": "I set her up with this actor on my show.\n", "You set her up?!\n": "No\n", "Joey what-what were you thinking?!\n": "Well, I was thinking that it\u2019d probably be okay because Ross hasn\u2019t gone out with Rachel in five years!\n", "Joey, I\u2019m not worried about her! I\u2019m worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this  actor taking them?\n": "Hey! I\u2019m an  actor too! I\u2019m not sure.

Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.\n", "Damn those robots, they\u2019re supposed to be our faithful servants!\n": "Anyway, it wasn\u2019t the robot, it was the guy who controls him. Yeah, he doesn\u2019t like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E. knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one! Ohh!\n", "Well, why don\u2019t you just get him fired?\n": "I may have to, I hate to do it, but I\u2019m the star! Y\u2019know? There\u2019s a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.  Excuse me.  Joey Tribbiani. \n", " Joe! I\u2019m glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!\n": "Wow!\n", "The thing is it\u2019s kinda on the Q.T. The actor who has the part doesn\u2019t know he might be fired. It\u2019s the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.\n": "I\u2019m the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!\n", "Yeah, it's in there. \n": " Oh! Ohh!

No one knows!\n": "How?! When?!\n", "It happened in London.\n": "IN LONDON!!!\n", "The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.\n": "But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone! \n", "Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.\n": "All right! Man, this is unbelievable!\n", "I know, it's great!\n": "Aww, I don't want to see that!\n", "Come in.\n": "Hey Jessica.\n", " Hey Jess.\n": "Ah, this is my friend Rachel.\n", "\u2018Sup? \n": "Uh listen, here\u2019s your Soapie.

I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play    after you go.\n", "Well, at least we got these little guys out.\n": "Yeah.\n", "Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get    used to things crapping in my hand, huh?\n": "I'm gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds    around again.\n", "Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.\n": "What?\n", "Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now. And, plus,    here they'd have their own room.\n": "I could get a goose!\n", "You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.\n": "Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You're gonna get to    stay here! And, and it's good, you know, 'cause, 'cause now you have a    reason to come visit.\n", "I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame    cool guy handshake?\n": "Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.\n", "I had to go with the odds Rach.\n": " Hey! You guys! Remember that audition I had a while ago and didn\u2019t get the part?\n", "The commercial?\n": "No!\n", "That play?\n": "No!\n", "That other play?\n": "Nooo!\n", "The movie?\n": "Yes!!\n", "Ohh!\n": "Yes that\u2019s the one about the soldiers who fight in World War I!\n", "Oh, yeah! Back then y\u2019know, we called the Great War. It really was!\n": "Well anyway, the guy they wanted backed out and now they want me! I start shooting today!\n", "Wait! Wait! Wait! You can\u2019t start today! Today\u2019s the rehearsal dinner!\n": "Oh no, I\u2019ll be done by then.\n", "Oh. Well then way to go you big movie star!\n": "I know! All right, I\u2019ll see you guys over there! I\u2019m off to fight the Nazis.\n", "Oh, wait Joey! We fought the Nazis in World War II, not World War I.\n": "Whoa! Okay. Yeah well, who-who was in World War I? \n", "Vomit tux? Who vomited on\u2014y'know what, what you up to Joe?\n": "Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!\n", "Oh that's great!\n": "A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!\n", "Ugh, what's right with them?\n": "Why don\u2019t you like PBS, Pheebs?\n", "All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!\n": "I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.\n", "This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.\n": "Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!\n", "What-what are you talking about?!\n": "Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?\n", "Yeah. So?\n": "It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.\n", "Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.\n": "Well, may I ask for one example?\n", "Yeah, it's\u2026 Y'know there's\u2014no you may not!\n": "That's because all people are selfish.\n", "Are you calling me selfish?!\n": "Are you calling you people?  Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?\n", "Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?\n": "That he doesn't exist.\n", "You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear.... \n": " Hey! I got great news!\n", "Run, Joey! Run for your life! \n": "What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?\n", "No.\n": " Bite me?\n", "Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.\n": "Not a problem.\n", "Thanks.\n": " Hey, you know our phone's not working?\n", "What, that wasn\u2019t the great news?\n": "Only if you think it\u2019s better than this...  snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.\n", "Wha-\n": "Wha-\n", "I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!\n": "Hey!\n", "No, no, no, guys. She's right. We should get to work. I'll take stuff out of the closet, Joey you pack 'em and Ross you re-pack whatever Joey packs.\n": "You guys hear a ringing?\n", " What the hell is this?\n": "Hey! Handcuffs! And fur line, nice! I didn't know you guys had it in ya!\n", "I didn't know Monica had these!\n": "Mhm, maybe she used them with another boyfriend. Maybe Richard!\n", "So is your apron. You\u2019re wearing it like a cape.\n": "I mean, the job\u2019s easy and the money\u2019s good, you know? I guess I\u2019m going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.\n", "Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?\n": "Okay, I guess it doesn\u2019t seem that weird.\n", "Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still haven\u2019t gotten it.\n": "See, now it\u2019s weird again.\n", "Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right.  A smile goes a long way.  And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.\n": "Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Y\u2019know? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. It\u2019s all about turnover.\n", "Or that.\n": "I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.\n", "I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.\n": "Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!\n", "Yeah!\n": "Do you know something?\n", " All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.\n": "Done!\n", "And it can't be Joey.\n": "It's not.\n", "Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?\n": "Maybe she never got your message.\n", " Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me.  Yeah I know; we\u2019d be great together!\n": "Hey! So I\u2019m back.\n", "Who are you?\n": "Joey Tribbiani! From the wall!  Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh?  Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I\u2019m ready to go back up on the wall I\u2019m the star of a new TV show.\n", " Show me in the table.\n": "Oh well, it\u2019s not on TV yet.\n", "Well, then it\u2019s not on the wall yet.\n": "Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh? \n", "And that\u2019s Phoebe , and that\u2019s Joey.\n": "Hey,  how you doin\u2019?\n", "Cut to Joey's apartment. Joey looks inside the cardboard box that   used to be the home of Chick Jr. and Duck Jr., but they have   disappeared.)\n": "Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.?

Why?!\n": "Well because you didn't give me advice! No! You gave me a pickup line! As soon as I told her I wanted to y'know, build a foundation and be friends first. I suddenly, through no fault of my own, became irresistible to her!  And her roommate!\n", "Yeah. I actually am, yeah. Y'know life-life\u2019s gonna had you all kinds of stuff, y'know you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow. Wanna hear a new song?\n": "Yeah.\n", "No way. \n": "I\u2019m not answering that.\n", "Joey!  No way. I\u2019m not answering that. \n": "Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together that\u2019s  $12.75.\n", "How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?\n": "Oh that\u2019s on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.\n", "Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?\n": "Well, he\u2019s not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him\u2014He says it\u2019s okay.  Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!\n", "Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn\u2019t free?\n": "It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I\u2019m getting more dates than ever!\n", "Yeah Joey that is so gross!\n": "How about a scone on the house baby?\n", "All right.

Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, \"God, your brother.\" Know what they\u2019ll say this year? \"God, you\"\n": "Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying.  I\u2019m an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue. \n", "Really you can do that?\n": "Are you kidding me? Watch!  Well I can\u2019t do it with you guys watching me!\n", "Okay!!\n": " Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you\u2019re mad, but I just want to say I\u2019m sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y\u2019know?

And the whole gang!\n", "Great, now he's waving back.\n": "Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!\n", "What kinda stuff?\n": "Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.\n", "You cook naked?\n": "Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.\n", "Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?\n": "How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.\n", "And he's not speaking metaphorically.\n": " So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh?\n", "\n\n": "\n", "Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.\n": "Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out! \n", " I love you!\n": "Hey, that's why I didn't invite you. you have to calm down, alright... go, go get yourself a drink or something...\n", "Rachel!!

You're the funny one! \n": "Uhh, look Katie, uh listen, we-we need to talk. Okay? Umm, look I like you. I-I really do, I like you a lot. Okay? But sometimes when you, when you playfully punch me like that it-it feels like someone's hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat.\n", "Joey stop staring! There\u2019s nothing there! It\u2019s not true!\n": "I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna need proof.\n", "Oh! \n": "Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?\n", "Joey, you don\u2019t have to finish that.\n": "Oh yes I do. Otherwise what\u2019s next? Today I\u2019m just a guy who can\u2019t finish a turkey, but tomorrow I\u2019m the guy who eats half a Powerbar, wraps up the rest, and puts in the fridge? No! No, I just\u2026I just\u2014I gotta change my pants.  Jeans have no give. \n", "Okay.  It\u2019s exactly how I\u2019d imagined it would be.\n": " All right where\u2019s that turkey!\n", "Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable       time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.\n": "Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.\n", "Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. \n": "Hold on, you-you knew?\n", "Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. \"I'm sleeping over at my accountant's,\" I mean, what is that? Please!\n": "So then how could you I mean, how could you?!\n", "Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.\n": "Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?\n", "Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.\n": "I'm...happy...for you?\n", "Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.\n": "Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.\n", "I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?\n": "Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.\n", "The picture of my wife!

What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?\n", "So how was, how was your date?\n": "Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still\u2026 And guess what, I\u2019m thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.\n", "Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?\n": "No-no-no-no-no! It\u2019s a surprise, but it\u2019s gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.\n", "Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she\u2019s not lookin\u2019 for a serious relationship.\n": "Where are you gettin\u2019 this?\n", "Well, she told me. She said she\u2019s kinda a loner.\n": "Oh.

No. Don\u2019t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.\n", "Well that too.  Joey?\n": "Yeah?\n", "Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.  Oh, hi Joey!\n": "Hey Pheebs!  Hey!\n", "What's up?\n": "Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.\n", "Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.\n": "That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!\n", "Well, you just\u2026\n": "I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!\n", "Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.\n": "At least I care about his feelings!\n", "And why wouldn't he get it?\n": "Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!\n", "Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?\n": "You just give him a spoon baby!\n", "Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!\n": "Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!\n", "Joey, get out of the fridge.\n": "All right, all right. \n", "What is that? \n": "That's fire. Beats everything.\n", "That's nice. Get out Let's go, come on.\n": "All right, I'm going. I'm going.\n", "I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug.\n": "Do we have to know about that?\n", "Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?\n": "I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars.\n", "Well ah, what can you swing?\n": "How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?\n", "You don\u2019t have, anything?\n": "You wanna see what I got?  Okay? I\u2019ve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!\n", "Okay, I-I get the picture. Uh, thanks, for your time. \n": "And a 50.  Huh, these must be Chandler\u2019s pants.\n", "All right, wait! Just wait. Everybody just calm down. Okay? Let's give our friend Joey a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!\n": "No! I am not a pervert! Okay? It's just\u2026 I just\u2026 Kinda\u2026\n", "All right, look! Look. I think I can explain this.\n": "Thank you!\n", "Joey's a sex addict. \n": "What?!!  No I'm not!!\n", "It's okay! It's good! It's good. It's a disease!\n": "No! No! I am not a sex addict!\n", "Yes you are! That's the only way to explain all this stuff!\n": "No it isn't! No, it's not. Because you can also explain it with the truth!\n", "What's going on?\n": "We all hate Emily!\n", "You slept with my sister?\n": "Uh yes, but it was, we just did it once uh, in London.\n", "Monica, is this true?\n": "Of course it's true! How else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?\n", "Okay, but if it only happened that one time, how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day?\n": "Ahh\u2014oy! That was the underwear I was wearing that night in London. Right Monica?\n", "Are you sure Joe? Are you sure you're not just a sex addict?\n": "No! If anyone's a sex addict here, it's Monica! Yeah. Yeah. She has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since London!\n", "So that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.\n": "That makes sense!\n", "And the video camera?\n": "Uhh, Monica?\n", "I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.\n": "But sadly I could not be enticed.\n", "I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.\n": "Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not. Eh? All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket. I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs. \n", "Thanks so much for meetin\u2019 with me. Joey\u2019s told me so much about you!\n": "This is so exciting for her. Well, I\u2019ll let you two fash\u2026ists get down to business. \n", "I just thought he was nice, y'know? \n": " I can't believe you didn't know it was a line! \n", "Really! You got a place upstate?\n": "Sure!\n", "Well, I\u2019ll see you later.\n": "Okay, take it easy.\n", "Hey! That\u2019s my car.\n": "Really?

Especially with you. \n": "Psss, that is whack!\n", " Yeah?  Okay, I think I\u2019ll play it at the wedding.\n": "Yeah! Well, I think we\u2019ll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, \"You look 19,\" and then they just take it away like-like, \"No you don\u2019t.\"\n", "Well, I don\u2019t think Monica is gonna take this away.\n": "Wouldn\u2019t she?\n", "Do you have any ice?\n": "Check the freezer.

Umm, why do you have a copy of The Shining in your freezer?\n": "Oh, I was reading it last night, and I got scared, so.\n", "But ah, you\u2019re safe from it if it\u2019s in the freezer?\n": "Well, safer. Y'know, I mean I never start reading The Shining, without making sure we\u2019ve got plenty of room in the freezer, y'know.\n", "How often do you read it?\n": "Haven\u2019t you ever read the same book over and over again?\n", "Well, umm, I guess I read Little Women more than once. But I mean that\u2019s a classic, what\u2019s so great about The Shining?\n": "The question should be Rach, what is not so great about The Shining. Okay? And the answer would be: nothing. All right? This is like the scariest book ever. I bet it\u2019s way better than that classic of yours.\n", "Okay. Ah, well we\u2019ll just see about that, okay. I will read The Shining,  and you will read Little Women. \n": "All right, you got it.\n", "All right.\n": "Pheebs! Pheebs! Ross wants to kiss you at midnight!\n", "Okay.\n": "Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.\n", "It\u2019s okay, I\u2019m ready.\n": "No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you\u2019re ready to answer the question.\n", "This is ridiculous, he\u2019s not gonna hold his breath\u2026 \n": "Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris\u2026Holy cow, that\u2019s a big word. Trisc\u2026 Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?\n", "Let me see that.\n": "This one right here. \n", " The fear of Triscuts! \n": "No! No, fear of the number 13.\n", "It\u2019s possible, they have really sharp edges.\n": "All right Chandler, you\u2019re up.\n", "Oh come on Ross, I think we\u2019re all losers here.\n": "All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.\n", "Let me think. Let me think\u2014Oh!

Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone. \n": "....Are we still talking about sex?\n", "Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.\n": "Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.\n", " What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.\n": "I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game.

I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.\n", "Rachel said she\u2019d marry you?!\n": " This isn\u2019t the right room, sorry folks. \n", "Phoebe is, making people.\n": "Everybody\u2019s doing stuff!\n", "And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!\n": " We could climb Mt. Everest!\n", "No-no, not something stupid, something huge.\n": "No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!\n", "Why not?! I mean it\u2019s just, it\u2019s just climbing! It\u2019s just, it\u2019s just steep!\n": "Yeah!\n", " Hey!\n": "Hey! What\u2019s up?\n", "What-what\u2019s up?\n": "We\u2019re gonna climb Mt. Everest!\n", " Yeah, well\u2026\n": "We could get that Everest video though.\n", "Yeah, we could do that without y\u2019know risking our lives at all!\n": "And while we\u2019re down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard!  Oh, y\u2019know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.\n", "Yeeeeahhhh.\n": "Yeah. Yeah.\n", "But I\u2019ll tell you something. One of these days we\u2019re get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!\n": "Yeah we are!\n", "Ok, let\u2019s work from the top down!  Just work the bra, Joe!\n": "Ok, yeah, got it.\n", "Oh!\nOw!\n": "Sorry!\n", "Well this is romantic!\n": "I'm sorry!  This never happened to me   before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can   do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open!   I blame your bra!\n", "It\u2019s a standard issue bra clasp!\n": "Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me   off with all your slapping!\n", "I\u2019m here to see Mary-Angela.\n": "You are so the man!  Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, \u2018cause my Grandma doesn\u2019t know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.\n", "Where\u2019s Mary-Angela?\n": "She\u2019s right in there. \n", "Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.\n": "Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!\n", " Hello!\n": "Hey!  Ah!! \n", " Noo.\n": "Don\u2019t worry man, I get to bring a guest. We\u2019ll show him.\n", "I never knew that either.\n": "I knew that!  I sooo didn\u2019t know that, but you should see your faces.\n", " Hey guys! What\u2019s up?\n": "Heyyy. \n", "You made pancakes?\n": "Yep! Grab a plate.\n", "Okay. \n": "In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!\n", "Okay, okay, but don\u2019t worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which I\u2019m fairly certain are the same thing.\n": "Listen also we\u2019re uh, we\u2019re watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.\n", "Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.\n": "Oh yeah, who\u2019s playing?\n", " Please, it\u2019s a relief is what it is, is what it is.\n": "All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!\n", "Especially Ross!\n": " Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y\u2019know what? I\u2019ll-I\u2019ll come back later. \n", "Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along    to my bosses and they weren't interested.\n": " Oh.\n", " I'm sorry man.\n": " But, ehm... you watched    the tape?\n", " Yeah! I... I... I liked it!  But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it.    Stupid sons of bitches!\n": " You didn't watch the tape.\n", " What!? Of course I did!\n": "Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?\n", "I'm not lying to you, I watched it!\n": "Well, you lied again! \n", "I watched it!\n": "Keep going Pinocchio!\n", "  I did!\n": " No you didn't! \n", "Since when do you watch the news? \n": "Uh, for your information, since they hired a very hot weather girl.\n", "Fine! Fine! But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here,  \u201cIf you accept full responsibility...\u201d  Full responsibility! \u201c...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do.  Does it?!!\u201d\n": "No?\n", " Yeah, I know. I mean, no, you\u2019re right. Yeah I guess I\u2019ll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.\n": "Sure, it\u2019s hard to forget! But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never,  ever talk about.\n", "Ok! Can't believe I'm risking  this again, but you're on! All right Joe, you remember the rules! Heads I win, tails you lose.\n": "Just flip!\n", "Ha, tails!\n": "Damnit!\n", "Yeah.  Oh no wait, I\u2019m not an nine-year-old girl.\n": "Then why do you throw like one?\n", "Maybe Monica has a bobby pin.\n": "Sure. \"Monica.\"\n", "So, how\u2019s the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?\n": "Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now.  Wow, you sure found that quick.  I just\u2014I wish I didn\u2019t feel this way about Rachel anymore, y\u2019know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think\u2026I think Ross feels left out. Y\u2019know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God\u2026 You should\u2019ve seen the look on Ross\u2019s face.  By the way, I have no idea what I\u2019m doing here. For all I know I\u2019m just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?\n", "That\u2019s a good idea.\n": "Yeah.\n", "Okay.  So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?\n": "Oh, I just\u2026I feel terrible.\n", "Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.\n": "Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.\n", "Yes, that's Raspberry coule.\n": " So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to     be healthy. \n", " Oh my God! \n": "Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.\n", "Mmmm! Mmm!\nOh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?\n": "Oh yeah, sure. No problem.\n", "What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.\n": "Sure I do.  Coule?\n", " No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.\n": " Really?\n", "Really! Now this all better be here when I come back. \n": "Yeah, of course. I can control myself. \n Stop staring at me!\nWhy, just a tiny little...\nOh-oh!\n", "IME LAPSE\n": "I'm not even sorry.\n", "A friend-ship...\n": "Wow! You blow my mind...\n", "Oh, I gotta go.\n": "Aaahh... How much do I owe you?\n", "Twenty bucks.\n": "It's like the cheapest college ever.\n", "Wow! Tell me something Joey\u2014\u2014Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.\n": "Yeah you did.\n", "Okay.  \n": "Here you go. Let me ask you a question.\n", "I\u2019m soo glad I caught you, I couldn\u2019t find you before.\n": "Wh-wh-what\u2019s going on? Wh-what\u2019s this about L.A.?\n", "They still want me for General Hospital.\n": "But, but wh-what about us?\n", "Last night was wonderful. But I-I can\u2019t stay here just for you.\n": "Well, so, stay for the museums! \n", "Joey, onstage!\n": "Well can you at least stay to the end of the play? I mean, I\u2019ll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye.\n", "Vic! Vic! Vic!!! \n": " In a minute!!\n", "So this is it? Victor?\n": "Yeah, I guess it is.  Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick \u2018cause this is killing me. One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you. But, you\u2019ve got things you have to do now, and so do I. And so\u2026 I\u2019m gonna get on this spaceship,  and I\u2019m gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels. But when I return, 200 years from now, you\u2019ll be long gone. But I won\u2019t have aged at all.  So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I\u2019m gonna want to meet her. \n", "Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  Nice talk, Aunt Syl.  You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?\n": "Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  This is your baby.  Hi Daddy! \n", "Hey! You\u2019re a good dancer!\n": "Really?\n", "Yeah, well you\u2019d be better if you just loosened your hips a little.\n": "What do you mean?\n", "Like this.\nThat\u2019s it, feel the rhythm. That\u2019s better.\n": "Uh-huh.\n", " Okay, you\u2019re dancing with that girl over there.\n": "No-no-no-no-no we came together!\n", "I don\u2019t see it.  You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! \n": "No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.\n", "If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.\n": "Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry...\n", " Morning.\n": "Morning, Paul.\n", "Yeah.  Thank you. \n": "That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?\n", "Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.\n": "Yeah, I'm an actor.\n", "Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?\n": "I doubt it. Mostly regional work.\n", "Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.\n": "Look, it was a job all right?\n", "'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'\n": "I will not take this abuse. \n", "You're right, I'm sorry.  \"Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...\"\n": "You should both know, that he's a dead man.\u00a0 Oh, Chandler?  \n", "True story.\n": "They're here already?\n", "Are you're hands still wet?\n": "Uh, moist, yeah.\n", "What about shut up?\n": "You shut up!  I love arguing with her.  I\u2019ll be right back. \n", "Oh well, I guess Italian isn\u2019t one of the four languages you speak.\n": " Hey! You wanna go?\n", "Yeah, let\u2019s go.\n": "Okay. See you guys later.\n", "Yeah, see ya.\n": " Hey, thank you so much. \n", "It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?\n": " Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?\n", "Well\u2026I really have high hopes for my band.\n": " You were right. He is funny.\n", " Really? \n": "Dina, if you\u2019re having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby!  Dude, that\u2019s not a compliment!\n", "No Joey! I knew you wouldn\u2019t be supportive!\n": "So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You\u2019re gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself\u2026without a husband?! You can\u2019t be a single mother alone! You\u2019re gonna ruin your life!\n", "Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?\n": "No! No! No! It\u2019s different for you. You\u2019re so strong and together. You\u2019re not some dumb kid who doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing.\n", "Excuse me?\n": "Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by    the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it...    lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.\n", "So forcing her to marry Bobby is gonna make that happen?\n": "Maybe!  Well! Well\u2026so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts\u2014Oh forget it! I can\u2019t!\n", "Look, Rachel\u2019s told me how much easier you\u2019ve made all this on her. Why can\u2019t you do that for me?\n": "Because! \u2018Cause\u2026 \u2018Cause you\u2019re my baby sister!\n", "And you\u2019re my big brother! I mean, you\u2019re my favorite guy in the whole world. I\u2019m not even scared to tell mom and dad.

Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?\n": "Of course he\u2019s gonna have his Uncle Joey!\n", "We\u2019re gonna be all right. I mean, even if we\u2019re not married this baby is gonna be so loved. Not just by us.\n": "That\u2019s right! By his uncle too!\n", "Okay Bobby, why don\u2019t we just come over here and let them have a little moment. \n": "Come here! \n", "Well, you're gonna.\n": "I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...\n", "Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?\n": "Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...\n", "Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?\n": "No.\n", "No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \"No thanks, I'm married.\"\n": "You really think so?\n", "Yeah. I really do.\n": "Thanks, Chandler. \n", " Richard? We\u2019re ready for you.  Joey Tribbiani?

What?\n", "Phoebe just found out about Monica and Chandler.\n": "You mean how they're friends and nothing more? \n", "Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?\n": "Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!\n", "Ohhh, I-I would enjoy that!\n": "No-no-no! No-no wait Rach, you know what would even be more fun? Telling them.\n", "Ehhh, no, I wanna do Phoebe's thing.\n": "I can't take any\u2026\n", "No! You don't have to do anything! Just don't tell them that we know!\n": "Noo!

Oh, and there he is now.\n": "Hey!\n", "Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey. \n": "Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?\n", "Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.\n": "Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.\n", " your welcome again, I'm gonna make some coffee can I get   you anything?\n": "do you have any cake?\n", "Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?\n": "Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.\n", "Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...\n": "No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.\n", "Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...\n": "Pathetic mess? I know, but\u2014come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice.

Ross, Mike, Phoebe and Rachel gasp    and stare at Chandler and his baby. Joey hasn't figured it out yet.)\n": "(To Monica) Hey, so what is the big surprise?\n", "Phoebe nods.)\n": "Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get   over her.\n", "Is it better than the other salmon mousse?\n": "It's creamier.\n", "Yeah, well, is that better?\n": "I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?\n", " Waitressing?\n": "Uh-oh.\n", "Hey! You okay?\n": "Ooh, something hurts!\n", "Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!\n": "Are they?

Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.\n", "Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.\n": "Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.  \n", "No it's not!\n": " Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!\n", "When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?\n": " Maybe.

I\u2019m stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don\u2019t think so mister!\n": "Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!\n", "And you don\u2019t think taking care of our chick is work?\n": "That\u2019s not what I said. Okay, I just meant...\n", "I know what you meant!!  You notice that ever since we got this chick, we\u2019ve been fighting a lot more than we used too?\n": "I don\u2019t know, maybe we weren\u2019t ready to have a chick.\n", "I\u2019ll take her back tomorrow.\n": "Do you think we\u2019ll get our three bucks back?\n", " Ohhh, hey!

I gotta tell you, you're       making it so easy on me and Emma.\n": "Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want,       and when does she stop crying all night?\n", "Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's       in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep,       so...\n": "She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did       last night.\n", "Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.\n": "No, hey, it's been great.\n", "Yeah, that'll do it.\n": "Wow! So, how are you?\n", "I'm, I'm okay. \n": "Really?\n", "Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have       worked out? Of course.

It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.\n", "I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.\n": "No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is.\n", "Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.\n": "I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!\n", "If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.\n": "Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!\n", "I\u2019m gonna be really late for dance class!\n": "Okay. \n", "Okay, now I\u2019m really late. \n": "Okay, I\u2019m all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips? \n", "Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.\n": "I hate Pottery Barn too.

Boy, kids are mean when they\u2019re hungry.\n": "All right so, so what do I do?\n", "This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it\u2019s weird, it\u2019s awkward, but you gotta at least try.\n": "Yeah. Okay.  Whoa!  I almost forgot this was on your\u2026\n", "Joey, I\u2019m really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things\u2026\n": "I know. I know.\n", "It kinda worked. I mean y\u2019know, I don\u2019t know about you buy I haven\u2019t thought about our thing since all this.\n": "Hey you\u2019re right. Yeah, it\u2019s kinda been like us again a little bit.\n", "Yeah I know! I miss that.\n": "Me too. I mean I\u2026haven\u2019t thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn\u2019t feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.\n", "And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?! \n": " What's going on? \n", "Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. \n": "Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. \n", "Uh, Joey.. \n": "Oh, God!  \n", "We didn't change.. \n": "So that's it? It's over? Just like that? \n", "Look, I- I could go on pretending- \n": "Okay! \n", "Oh, that's right!  Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?\n": "Mmh-mmh.\n", " Can you say Barbados?\n": "Barbados!\n", "Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.\n": "All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.\n", "OK.  \n": "Shut up!\n", "Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.\n": "Thank you.\n", " We were playing poker, alright...\n": "There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?\n", "There just don't happen to be any women in our games.\n": "Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.\n", "Trouble?\n": "Your sister stood me up the other night.\n", " Well, thank God your    livelihood doesn't depend on it.\n": "I know, right?     Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?\n", "Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy    she's ever met.\n": "Seriously? She actually said that?\n", "Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?\n": "Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!\n", "onia\n": "oey\n", "So what job did you get Joe?\n": "Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.\n", "Well, how can you be a tour guide, don\u2019t you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?\n": "No, not really. They give you all the information, it\u2019s uh, it\u2019s like memorizing a script.  \"And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.\n", "Uh actually Joey, it\u2019s the Cretasous period.\n": "Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.\n", "Yeah\n": "You\u2019re really thinking about having sex with your brother?!\n", "Ewww! And \"Oh no!\" It\u2019s\u2014they just want me to be the surrogate. It\u2019s her-it\u2019s her egg and her sperm, and I\u2019m-I\u2019m just the oven, it\u2019s totally their bun. \n": "Huh.\n", "Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.\n": "No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we\u2019ll be supportive like crazy.\n", " Oh, do you, do you really?\n": "Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.\n", "Look, if you don't know what the word \"acrimonious\"    means, just don't use it!\n": "No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her    body is soo...\n", "Get to the problem!\n": "Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've    ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!\n", " Are you wearing two belts?\n": " EH, what do you know!\n", "You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.\n": "Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural    places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!\n", "You know, I really don't want to    get involved in you guy's relationship.\n": "Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really    like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.\n", " Fine.\n": "Thanks.\n", "Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!\n": "The Metsss!\n", "Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n": " Oh, that's what she meant!  You know, if they're    gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum,    and avoid all the confusion!\n", "Yeah, most of it it's a place  packed with confused angry    baseball fans!\n": "Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.\n", "Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore    on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture,    you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the    Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that    she'd love.\n": "Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!\n", "But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for    Thai food...\n": "Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too    fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?\n", "Ok.\n": "Alright!\n", "Oh! What a game, huh?\n": "I know, yeah.\n", "I can't believe Chandler is missing this!\n": "Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say,  I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.\n", "Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.\n": "Ohhhh! These seats are great!\n", "I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice  I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!\n": " Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.\n", "Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.\n": "I don't know...\n", "One more fight!\n": "Okay.\n", " What\u2019s so funny?\n": "Oh, nothing, no. It\u2019s an acting exercise, I\u2019m practising my fake laugh.\n", "Oh. \n": " Ross!\n", "Oh my God, I can't believe you're here!\n": " I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!\n", "Doctor Geller, I'm such a huge fan!\n": "That... never happens...\n", " Are you a paleontologist?\n": "No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called \"The Days of Our Lives\".\n", "Dude, it's just \"Days of Our Lives\"... there's no the.\n": " Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.\n", "Y\u2019know what? I don\u2019t like you without mom.  Come on. \n": " We\u2019re not peeking? \n", "achel\n": "oey\n", "Listen, they are really great. If you just got a chance\u2026\n": "Y\u2019know what? Why don\u2019t you just give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here?\n", "We didn\u2019t get anything for anyone.\n": "Hm-mm! Yeah nice necklace!\n", "Uh-huh!\n": "I think I'm gonna take-off.\n", "And have you .. ed?\n": "No, no, no!\n", "But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?\n": "Probably.\nNo, no!\n", "Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you.   I'm fine!\n": "Really?\n", "Absolutely.  I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know  why   it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really,   I'm fine.   I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys  kissing. I mean, at first I was like..  But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.\n": "Ross..\n", "No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night.   I'll cook!!\n": "Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?\n", "Joe, I told you, you're just not right for    the part.\n": "What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor    you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?\n", "Joe...\n": "Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't    pass it on to your bosses!\n", "Fine!\n": "Thank you. \n", "Work, Joe!\n": "Damn it! \n", "What am I gonna do now?\n": "Just pass it to your boss!\n", "I know. They were mine.\n": "Oh.  No! No wait, that\u2019s weird!\n", "No, it\u2019s not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on.\n": "That\u2019s weird!\n", "I\u2019m wearing his briefs right now.\n": "That\u2019s\u2026kinda hot.\n", "I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick.\n": "Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t know about that.\n", "And! Y\u2019know what Jake says? That women\u2019s underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin.\n": "Yeah well next thing you know, he\u2019ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!\n", "There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I\u2019m thinking even more than you.\n": "Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys.\n", "I\u2019m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women\u2019s underwear! I don\u2019t think you could ever do that.\n": "Hey! I am secure with my masculinity.\n", " So, I have to go shopping today, which is my least favourite thing, I'm soo bad at picking out clothes!\n": "So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.\n", " Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!\n": "Oh hey Rach!\n", "I'm sure you have better things to do.\n": "Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.\n", "Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!\n": " Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!\n", " Ok, great! All right, bye!  Pain in the ass!!  That's off, right?\n": "What's the matter, Pheebs?\n", "Ok, that'll be great!\n": "Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.\n", "That's not what we're gonna do!\n": "Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?\n", "ng Credits\n": " Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh\u2026 Oh wait, I don\u2019t have to lie to you, you don\u2019t live here anymore. Uh, I\u2019m eating their food. What are you doing?\n", "Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.\n": "Whoa, I didn\u2019t know we could date your sister!\n", "Yuck!\n": "I can\u2019t believe Ross went out with Rachel\u2019s sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.\n", "That was like 5 years ago.\n": "Yeah you got 5 years left!\n", "Well, you couldn\u2019t get them anyway. Ian doesn\u2019t plan anymore and Derrick\u2026  And Derrick is a name I shouldn\u2019t know.\n": " Hey Mon, do you have another pillow?  Y\u2019know, something a little snugglyer?\n", "Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?\n": "Well, the duck\u2026\n", "What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!\n": "Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!\n", "Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!\n": "Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!\n", "Right there! That's why I'm marrying you!\n": " Hello Michael.\n", "Joseph.\n": "May I have a word with you, please?\n", " This is... great...\n": "Have a seat.  Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me...  I cannot allow this. \n", " Are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?\n": "More back talk. And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for \"Family Honor 2: Thissa Time Itsa Personal.\" \n", "Joey, I kinda have a lot to do today, what do you want?\n": "I want you to take this seriously! Phoebe is very very important to me, ok? And I wanna make sure that you are gonna take care of her.\n", " Joe, I love Phoebe. She's the single most important thing in my life. I'd die before I let anything happen to her. \n": " That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family. \n", "That must have been one lousy movie.\n": " That was ME!\n", "Thanks!\n": "Yeah.\n", "What's up Joe?\n": "Well, the reason I think Monica and Chandler are so great\u2026\n", " What are you saying?\n": "I'm saying maybe you and I crank it up a notch.\n", "Y'know honey, umm, as uh, as flattered as I am that uh, you saw me first, uhh, I just, I-I don't think we should be cranking anything up.\n": "I'll treat you real nice. \n", " Yeah, well, y'know umm\u2026 No honey, listen I think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them, but I think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone, become their friend, build a foundation, then you ask them out on a date. Don't hit on your existing friends!\n": "Won't-won't that take longer?\n", " Is this yours?\n": "Well actually\u2026\n", "No-no-no! It\u2019s mine! It\u2019s-it\u2019s mine. \n": "Dude, you soooo need this car.\n", "It is off.\u00a0 Right Ross? \n": "Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.\n", "No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.\n": "Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. \n", "Hi, Joey.\n": "My god, Angela.\n", "Are you gonna go over there?\n": "No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela. \n", " Joey.\n": "You look good.\n", "That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.\n": "You don't say.\n", "Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.\n": "Bob? Who the hell's Bob?\n", "Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...\n": "Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.\n", "Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?\n": "What?\n", "We're just friends.\n": "Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?\n", "Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, \"Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!\"  Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!\n": "What happened?\n", " All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me\u2026 Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh\u2026 \n": "You kissed him?!\n", "What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?\n": "Yeah!  No?\n", "Maybe. I-I don't know\u2014Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!\n": "Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on.  She's back! Hot girl's back!\n", "Ohh, well I'm not totally back yet, but thank you.\n": "No, in Ross's building!  She's back! She's back!  Okay, wait there, I'll be over in a second.  Got it! \n", " Here!\n": "Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were! \n", "You may want to lose the foam finger!\n": "Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!\n", "We're late too! \n": "We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time \n", "So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!\n": "Yeah, where were you!\n", "And it looks like she put makeup on her!\n": "Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...\n", "So this is an annual thing?\n": " Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!\n", "Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.\n": "All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae. \n", "Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!\n": "No. Here \n", "Guess what, I got an audition!\n": "Awww, one of my students got an audition. I\u2019m so proud.\n", "I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?\n": "You bet! What\u2019s the part?\n", "Maybe he\u2019s just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?\nMaybe the pogo-stick likes it too?\n": "All right, that\u2019s it! He cannot do this to Phoebe.  This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime!  But, is he a big guy?\n", "Ms. Green would like to establish some ground rules before she comes out. She would appreciate it if you don\u2019t use the words old or downhill or  they still look pretty damn good. \n": "They do!\n", "Well, can I keep the presents and still be 29?\n": "Come on Rach! Look, turning thirty is not that big a deal.\n", "Oh really. Is that how you felt when you turned thirty?\n": " Why God?!! Why?!! We had a deal!! Let the others grow old! Not me!! \n", "No Rach, it\u2019s not just you. My thirtieth birthday certainly wasn\u2019t that much fun.\n": " And now Chandler! We\u2019re all gettin\u2019 so old!  Why are you doing this to us?! \n", "What?! Look, we\u2019re trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?\n": "Look, Ross look, I\u2019m on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that\u2019s gonna get you in trouble.\n", "He\u2019s right. Nobody\u2019s gonna benefit, and you\u2019re just gonna hurt her.\n": "Yeah, and there won\u2019t be a relationship left to rebuild.\n", "Yeah, okay. \n": "All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn\u2019t find out some other way.  Did you think about the trail?\n", "What trail?\n": " The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it!  You always have to think about the trail!\n", "What\u2019d you rent?\n": "Die Hard 2.\n", " Joey, this is Die Hard 1 again.\n": "Oh, well we watch it a second time and its Die Hard 2!\n", "Joey, we just saw it!\n": "And?\n", "Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it! \n": "Gotcha.\n", "Uh sure.\n": "Okay. \n", "Action!\n": " \"Take good care of your Momma son.\" \n", " Hey, Joey, I got you another present. \n": "Oh wait, before you tell me what it is!  Okay, what is it?\n", "What are you talking about? I love them!  Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?\n": "Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey! \n", "A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.\n": "And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...\n", "All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.\n": "But what does that gonna do...\n", "For Chandler!\n": "Okay. I'm in.\n", "Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'\n": "Does it have to be a whole day?\n", "Hey Joe what\u2019s up?\n": "I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Y\u2019know, everywhere I look she\u2019s like\u2026 \n", "I can see why that\u2019s hard to resist.\n": "I like her so much!\n", "Aw, I\u2019m sorry sweetie that she doesn\u2019t feel the same way.\n": "I know. And she\u2019s so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.\n", "Well they said I should bring someone.  Do you wanna be my dance partner?\n": "Totally! I would love to spend New Year\u2019s with you.\n", "Bye Janine!\n": "Did she just ask me out on a date?\n", "Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think that was a romantic thing.\n": "Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. We\u2019re going to a New Year\u2019s Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Y\u2019know? But if she says \u2018Dude, what the hell are you doing?\u2019 I can say \u2018It wasn\u2019t me, it was New Years!\u2019\n", "You slept with her didn\u2019t you?\n": "Little bit, yeah.\n", "Wow! This picture of you sure is steamy.\n": "Oh yeah, that\u2019s just a little something for my huge gay fan base. \n", "Did you just wink at me?\n": "Hey, you\u2019re the one that loves the picture.\n", "Ezel? Ezel? Ezel? \n": " Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?\n", "Sweet!\n": "All right, well finish your coffee; let\u2019s go.\n", "Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.\n": "To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you\u2019re not gonna be on TV!\n", "No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.\n": "Oh, you\u2019re switching apartments?\n", "It\u2019s not for me, it\u2019s for Rachel.\n": "But Rachel has an apartment.\n", "Yeah, but when the baby comes she\u2019s gonna want to move.\n": "She is?\n", "Yeah, you didn\u2019t expect her to live there with a baby did you?\n": "I guess I didn\u2019t really think about it.\n", "All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.' \n": "And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like,  'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!' \n", "You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?\n": " Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!\n", "Joey, we have something to tell you.\n": "Oh my God! You\u2019re pregnant!\n", "No-o-o!  No?  No-o-o! Look Joey, here\u2019s the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I\u2019m gonna be moving out man.\n": "Wow!  Well, uh\u2026 Hey! I\u2019m really happy for you guys! Congratulations!  See you later. \n", "Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!\n": "Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job.  Like you\u2019d believe that. This sucks!\n", "Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!\n": "Hey, did you get to the part where they\u2019re trapped in the car and\n", "are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?\n": "Oh uh, it didn\u2019t work out.\n", "Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?\n": "Oh uh, okay. Yeah.\n", "me.\n": "Oh sure, yeah, why not? \n", "Cujo! That\u2019s Cujo!\n": "All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it\u2019ll be okay.\n", "I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.\n": "Can we see her?\n", " Yeah. \n": "Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. \n", "I'm okay.\n": "What?!?! Oh dear God!\nNot much to tell there I\u2019m really shy.\n", "When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.\n": "You gotta tell Ross how you feel.\n", "Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?\n": "What about her?

I\u2019m having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.\n", "Wait! You\u2019re going out with Kathy!\n": "Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?\n", "Well, I\u2019m upset\u2014for you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. \n": "What is the big deal? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re exclusive.\n", "Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she\u2019s-she\u2019s smart, and funny, and gets you.\n": "You got all that from the back of her head?\n", "Ewww! \n\ufffdHola, Joey! \n": "\ufffdHola, amigos! \n", " Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?\n": "Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.\n", "No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?\n": "Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.\n", " H-He's in China!\n": "The country.\n", "Well then maybe you shouldn't go. \n": "He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait.\n", "What's that?\n": "It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.\n", "It's a baby chick and duck!\n": "Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.\n", "I did not see that coming.\n": "Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house, you know? It    has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to    that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.\n", "Is Rachel here?\n": "Uh, I think she's still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you    guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.\n", "Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell, but I'm also not one to have    sex and shut up. We totally did it!\n": "Oh my God. You and Rachel?\n", "I know, it's pretty great.\n": "So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?\n", " Yay!\n": "So, so is she still going to Paris?\n", "Guess we'll never know how it ends.\n": "Okay.\n", "Good.\n": "I bet you did!\n", "Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?\n": "Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?\n", "Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.\n": "Yeah right! \n", "No really, I-I am! I feel bad!\n": "Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, \"Hmm, noodle soup.\" \n", "Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.\n": "What you do mean?\n", "I think, sub-consciously\u2026\n": "Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.\n", " I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.\n": "Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine.  Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor\u2026\n", "There you go. Thank you!\n": "Thank you! So, did-did he get it?\n", "So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.\n": "Oh no, not you too!\n", "No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay\u2019s checks; there were a lot of them.\n": "Nice!\n", "Um-mmm, and I won\u2019t have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.\n": "That\u2019s great, but isn\u2019t it gonna bother that people still think you\u2019re a porn star?\n", "Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.\n": "You do?\n", "It's kidney stones.\n": "Or?\n", "Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination. \n": "What?! \n", "Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head,  up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands! \n": "It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands. \n", "Well, I tell you what. Why don\u2019t we uh, why don\u2019t we just stay here? Let\u2019s not see a movie, we\u2019ll just hang.\n": "And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?\n", "Hey, if that\u2019s what you want to do I\u2019m not gonna say no.\n": "Dude! What is going on?!\n", "I just\u2026I have to find out how it went.\n": "Why?\n", "This guy could be my baby\u2019s stepfather!\n": "They go on one date and you\u2019re worried about them getting married?! He\u2019s not you!\n", "I just\u2014I-I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s-she\u2019s dating?!\n": "Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?\n", "I don\u2019t know! I guess I just can\u2019t believe any of this is happening.\n": "What do you mean?\n", "It\u2019s just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan\u2019s, it\u2019s like\u2014It breaks my heart a little. I mean I\u2019ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y\u2019know? Maybe fight over the science section.\n": "That\u2019s a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!\n", "No! No I can\u2019t. I mean Rachel\u2019s out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.\n": "Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?\n", "It used to be. Now she doesn\u2019t really have a face. Smokin\u2019 body though.\n": "Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn\u2019t Rachel.\n", "No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?\n": "I know, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what she wants.\n", "No, it\u2019s not what I want either. I mean I-I can\u2019t force myself to fall in love with her again now.\n": "That\u2019s okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It\u2019s not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there\u2019s gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?\n", "That was an obvious joke, and I didn\u2019t think of it. Why didn\u2019t I think of it? The source of all my powers. Oh dear God, what have I done!\n": " Hey, how much will you give me to eat this whole jar of olives?\n", "I won\u2019t give you anything, but you\u2019ll owe me 2.95.\n": "Done.\n", "Hold on.\n": "Ross? You okay?\n", "Well, if you don\u2019t have anything to copy, why are you going down there?\n": "Yeah, are you just going down there to gawk at that hot girl with the belly button ring again?\n", "Yeah! You wanna come?\n": "Yeah!\n", "Do you have a minute? I\u2019d like to talk to you about something I\u2019m, I\u2019m really uncomfortable talking about.\n": "Sure. What? About uh, you showering with your mom?\n", "I actually had a topic in mind! I\u2019m, I\u2019m kinda going through a dry spell, sex wise.\n": "Whoa, for like months?\n", "Five to be lying, six.\n": "Six months? Whoa that\u2019s rough.\n", "Well, I mean it\u2019s not all bad. I\u2019m learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.\n": "The sky\u2019s blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!\n", "Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okay\u2014I\u2019m scared for my health!\n": "Okay. Okay. Umm\u2026Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. It\u2019s this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; they\u2019re like putty.\n", "Really? Well then tell it to me.\n": "Okay. Now you\u2019re gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.\n", " I\u2019ll try to control myself.\n": "Okay.  Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europe\u2026\n", " You were backpacking across Western Europe?\n": "Have a nice six more months Ross! \n", " Okay! Okay! Okay. I\u2019m sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?\n": "I was just outside Barcelona hiking in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo. I was at the end of this path and I came to a clearing and there was a lake, very secluded. And there were tall trees all around.  It was dead silent. Gorgeous.  And across the lake I saw\u2026a beautiful woman\u2026bathing herself\u2026but she was crying\u2026\n", "Yeah in fact, I\u2019m gonna go call her right now. And I\u2019ll make sure to tell her my friend Chandler says\u2026 \n": " Hey Chandler!\n", "Uh Joe, when it\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning and you don\u2019t come by? That\u2019s okay!\n": "Well check it out, I was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street!\n", "Really? Right across the street?\n": "Yeah!\n", "When\u2019d you meet her?\n": "Two days ago.\n", "Excellent! Y\u2019know Ross met somebody too!\n": "Oh yeah?\n", " Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross\u2019s situation?\n": "Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I\u2019m dating this girl who\u2019s also seeing another guy. But, I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not to worried about it.\n", "Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.\n": "How is \"Monica, I love your sweet ass,\" inappropriate?\n", "I can\u2019t believe they\u2019ve been together for three years.\n": " Has it been that long?!\n", "Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.\n": "Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!\n", "I've had a very long, hard day.\n": "Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?\n", "Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.\n": "Okay.\nYou sure? Some extra crispy? Dirty rice? Beans?\n", "I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t just tell us.\n": "I know! I mean it\u2019s not like we weren\u2019t cool about it.\n You?!  And-and you?!\n", " Get in here!!! \nOkay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?\n": "Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!\n", "I can not believe he would do that to Mon\u2014Whoa!  Joey, do they know that we know?\n": "No.\n", "God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know!  Joey, you can't say anything!\n": "I couldn't even if I wanted too.\n", "Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?\n": "Mine!\n", "Wait! It was my plan.\n": "Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.\n", "And, I came up with Atlantic City.\n": "Which, is the new plan!\n", "Of!\n": "Fortune! This guy is so stupid.  It's Count Rushmore!!\n", "You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?\n": "I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?\n", "No, Janice.\n": "Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.\n", "You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?\n": "No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?\n", "Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!\n": "Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.\n", "Well, there you go.\n": "I'm really sorry you guys.\n", "Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry, those are the right letters.\n": "Look, what do you want me to say?\n", "I want you to say that you like her!\n": "I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her. \n", "That and arrogance.\n": " Hey.\n", "Hey! How was sailing?\n": "I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Y\u2019know, you could\u2019ve at least saved me a whole cookie. \n", "I don\u2019t want to talk about it. Y\u2019know, you could\u2019ve at least saved me a whole cookie. \n": " Women are mean!!! \n", "Oh no wait, oh no, the elastic on my underwear busted.\n": " Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!\n", "Oh wait, Joey, you can\u2019t go like that! You stink!\n": "Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I don\u2019t have time! They\u2019re just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.\n", "Okay, so I guess that\u2019s about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.\n": " Hey!!\n", "Okay.  It\u2019s a chicken.\n": "It\u2019s cute, huh?\n", "Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot\u2019s and lot\u2019s of love.\n": "Oh, well no problem there. \n", "You!\n": "It\u2019s the chick! She\u2019s\u2026going through some changes.\n", "Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend\u2026Phyllis\u2026take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed. \n": " Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food!  What's the matter? \n", "Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away. \n": "So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero. \n", "Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me? \n": "Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.\n", "And that doesn't scare you?  \n": "Ross, you need some help? \n", "From you?  Yes, please! \n": " First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!\n", "Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth?  I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you.  Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out \n": "If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah. \n", " Hi! \n": "Monica? What time is it?\n", "Oh no, the dog's not going to be there! \n": "You think? \n", "No! No, I don\u2019t\u2026don\u2019t want to.\n": "How long since you\u2019ve seen a girl naked?\n", "I was backpacking across Western Europe.\n": "I\u2019m not feeling it.\n", "I was just outside Barcelona, hiking\u2026\n": "No! No! No Ross! I\u2019m not hot! Are you hot?\n", "It\u2019s been six months! I\u2019m always hot!\n": "Well you\u2019re not selling the story! It\u2019s like; it\u2019s like you don\u2019t believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when I\u2019m preparing for an audition. Okay? I\u2019ll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what you\u2019re doing wrong.\n", "I\u2019ll try that.\n": "All right now\u2026 All right, you\u2019re all set up. You\u2019re good to go. Just hit record. All right?\n", "Thanks. And-and hey Joe?\n": "Yeah?\n", "Listen, if you ever have any problem with the ladies you know I\u2019ll help you out.\n": " That means a lot to me man. \n", "What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!\n": "Y\u2019know what? This is not fair to her. Let\u2019s just forget the tape!\n", "Thank you.  No!\n": "You\u2019re right. \n", "Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!\n": "Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.\n", "Oh, why? What's up?\n": "I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, I'm fluent in.\n", "Oh... you're so sexy!\n": "Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.\n", "I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!\n": "Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.\n", "Too many jokes... must mock Joey! \n": "Nice shoes, huh? \n", "Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.\n": "Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?\n", "No, I\u2019m-I\u2019m not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with \"The.\"\n": "Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joey\u2019s your pal. Joey\u2019s your buddy. \"Where is everybody?\" \"Well, they\u2019re hanging out with Joey.\"\n", "Hey, y\u2019know what, if you\u2019re gonna do that, if you\u2019re gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler.  Oh, come on! Chandler\u2019s funny, sophisticated, and he\u2019s very loveable, once you get to know him.\n": "Oh well, hey, Joey\u2019s loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, he\u2019ll be there.\n", "Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he\u2019ll be there. And he\u2019ll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you\u2019re really hot.\n": "What do ya say? What do ya say?\n", "Ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.\n": "That's right, he almost could. Which is exactly how I got stuck there.\n", "You walked around all night in the city by yourself?\n": " He hooked up! He hooked up with someone.\n", "Look, I don't have to answer your questions! Okay? I'm a big boy, I can do whatever I want!\n": "He hooked up!! Tell us about her!\n", " I\u2019m training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.\n": "Look Rach, wasn\u2019t this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?\n", "Well, I\u2019m also sending out.... good thoughts.\n": "If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you\u2019ve got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.\n", "I have to tell you this story. Okay, I was coming over here and this driver\u2026\n": " Was his name Angus? \n", "Uh, The Wheatsheaf.\n": "Yeah-yeah-yeah, and they had that beer! That uh\u2026\n", "Yeah! \n": "That was good beer.\n", "Y'know, I think they have those at that British pub near the trade center.\n": "Later! \n", "That must be our alcohol and beers!  \n": "Hey!\n", "Ohh, I love Joey! Joey lives with a duck! \n": "Hi!\n", "I'll do it. Hey, whatever you need me to do, I'm your man.   Whoa-oh-whoa! Are you, are you okay?\n": "Yeah! I'm fine! Thanks!  Hey Rach, how you doin'?\n", "I'm doin' good, baby. How you doin'?\n": "Ross, don't let her drink anymore! \n", "Well it happened about six weeks ago, and uh I had just got home from work and Ross was already there \u2018cause I guess he had been hanging out with Joey.\n": "You\u2019re welcome buddy.\n", "Yes let\u2019s. Y\u2019know what? Uh, it\u2019s-it\u2019s not important. What is important is that, is that we\u2019re having a baby. And it\u2019s not\u2014Doesn\u2019t matter who came on to who.\n": "Whom.  That\u2019s right.\n", " Why don't you try to do-\n": " \n", "What's wrong?\n": "Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower.  Oh my God!\n", "Oh-no. No. No.\n": "What a bad idea!\n", "Yes. Are you one of the retarded cousins?\n": "Oh, no. Ah, I playing your husband, Victor. I\u2019m Joey Tribianni.\n", "Hi, nice to meet you. Kate Miller. \n": "So the ah, play\u2019s pretty great, huh?\n", "Oh, yeah. I love Jennifer Van Murray\u2019s work. She\u2019s so brilliantly incisive when it comes to deconstructing the psyche of the American middle class.\n": "Oh, forget about it. She rocks!\n", "Where do I know you from?\n": "Dr. Drake Remoray. Days of Our Lives. Voted most datable neurosurgeon by Teen Beat.\n", "No, that\u2019s not it. So, you\u2019re a soap actor? Well this must be pretty exciting for you to be in a real play, hmm?\n": "Hey, I\u2019ve done plays before. I\u2019m a serious actor.\n", "That info-mercial! For the milk carton spout thing! You\u2019re-you\u2019re-you\u2019re the guy that doesn\u2019t know how to pour milk!!\n": "See, I actually can pour milk, but I got you believing that I couldn\u2019t. Now, see, that\u2019s acting.\n", "Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us.   Just hangin'.\n": "Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?\n", "I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours. \n": " I don\u2019t think so.\n", " That was so wonderful!  Ohh, I think that you\u2019re a better Jessica than I ever was!\n": "Oh noo\u2026\n", "Well of course not, but you were very good.\n": "Thanks!\n", "And guess what? Good news! I got another job!\n": "Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!\n", "A film in Guadalajara!\n": "The airport?\n", "No that\u2019s La Guardia.  This is Mexico.\n": "Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?\n", "Eight months.\n": "That\u2019s a really long time.\n", "Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.\n": "Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first.  And I just got what you meant again\u2014That is\u2014I tell ya, that is a tricky one!\n", "That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You\u2019ve, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.\n": "Good luck.\n", "Are you all right?\n": " Oh my.\n", "Oh, so that\u2019s why the priest threw holy water on me.  Okay, listen, you have to cheer up! Okay? You should come out with Ross and me, I mean anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about Kate.\n": "Hey I was crying because, because nobody believed Quincy\u2019s theory. Okay?\n", "That\u2019s okay.\n": " Can I talk to you for a second?!\n", "Hey. \n": "Uh, listen I gotta double check for tickets tonight. Who-who got what?\n", "Why can\u2019t we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.\n": "I just got off the phone with my sister.\n", "Ah, which, which one?\n": "Mary-Angela.\n", "Mary-Angela.\n": "Yeah.\n", "Y'know which one was she again?\n": "Why don\u2019t you ask Chandler, \u2018cause he\u2019s the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin\u2019 over Janice by groping my sister. \n", "It\u2019s gotta be the first one.\n": "Really? That\u2019s great! You and my sister, sittin\u2019 in a tree.\n", "Okay, I know what I have to do. I\u2019ve got to go Red Ross.  Y\u2019know, Red Ross!\n": "I totally don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\n", "Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!\n": "No.\n", "Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.\n": "What did they do?\n", "You? You! Want to watch Ben?  Yes! That\u2019d be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is. \n": "Hey-hey, Ross?\n", "Hmm?\n": "...feel like getting a cup of coffee?\n", "All right!  Isn't this a woman's hat?\n": "Dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea!\n", "I couldn't possibly eat another bite. \n": "I need something sweet.\n", "Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.\n": "Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.\n", "That's sweet, Joey.\n": "Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. \n", "Yeah, sure. Umm\u2026here. \n": "Great.  You got anything that\u2019s not Ralph Lauren?\n", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think so Joe.\n": "All right, I guess this will be fine.\n", "Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?\n": "Nothing, why?\n", "How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I\u2019ll pay.\n": "Huh, Rach I got to say it\u2019s gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.\n", "I\u2019m not asking you to go on a date with him!\n": "Really? \u2018Cause I could kinda use the money.\n", "Joey, just-just he-he\u2019s new in town and I know he doesn\u2019t have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I\u2019ll really appreciate it.\n": "Yeah, okay.\n", "No, that wouldn\u2019t kill her. Ordinary embolism might.\n": "I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s got to be taking it hard, I was like    her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I\u2019m guessing    he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she\u2019s not a great agent, but    she did stick with me for ten years. I\u2019m gonna call her and hire her again.\n", "No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call    you \n": "Why?\n", "Because patience is the road to understanding  which ...    is the key... to a happy heart.\n": " You blow me away. \n", " All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her    to call you?\n": "I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason. \n", "Yeah! Hey, sure! The \"Days of Our Lives\" guy!\n": "That's right, yeah.\n", "You're not good!\n": "Always nice to meet a fan!\n", "What... what you working on?\n": " Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it    to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...\n", "Why don't you use your Thesaurus?\n": "What did I just say?\n", "Watch.  Here, you ehm... You highlight the word    you want to change.   Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list    of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.\n": "Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm...     \"brainy, bright, clever\", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey    Tribbiani's got the whole package!!\n", "I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!\n": "Oh hey! You got my parent\u2019s gift! \n", "Yeah. What is that?\n": "Well, I don\u2019t know. I think it does something to salami.\n", "Hey! How\u2019d it go?\n": "Yeah. What-what did Tag say?\n", "Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?\n": "I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. \n", "No, I will. I\u2019m just not up for it tonight.\n": "Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know you\u2019re not gonna be alone in this.\n", "I\u2019m not?\n": "Listen I uh\u2026  It\u2019s a scary world out there especially if you\u2019re a single mom. Y\u2019know, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Y\u2019know? So,  Rachel Green will you marry me?\n", "What?!!\n": "Pheebs, give me the ring back!\n", "No! Joey, oh you\u2019re so sweet. You\u2019re so-so sweet, honey. But I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not looking for a husband.\n": " I understand.\n", "I can\u2019t say that didn\u2019t hurt. But I\u2019ll take you back Joey Tribbiani.\n": "Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offered\u2026\n", "Ooh! A Salami Buddy!\n": "There you go!\n", " Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!\n": " Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.\n", "Yeah, let's go.   Thanks    Ross.\n": " Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me    up.\n", "Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?\n": "I don\u2019t know, Chandler is supposed to be passin\u2019 \u2018em around...\nChandler!\n", "Oh my!!\n": "Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.\n", "Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?\n": "No, only for sex.\n", " Joey!!! Happy Birthday!! \n": "Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!\n", "All right, ready?\n": "One.\n", "All right, here it goes...\n": " Doesn't work... \n", "Wow! Really?! We get all this rusty crap for free?!\n": "Uh-huh. This and a bunch of bubble wrap. And, some of it is not even popped! \n", " Bye... bye... BIRDIE.\n": "Oh!\n", "Uh.... bean! Bean!\n": " The Unbearable Likeness of Being!\n", "Ah, Sliced Bread, a wonderful Lady MacBeth.\n": "God, I just, I hate her! I hate her!! With her, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so talented.\u2019 and \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so pretty,\u2019 and \u2018Ooh, I smell so good.\u2019\n", "I think somebody has a crush on somebody.\n": "Hey, Chandler, can we please stay focused on my problem here?! Y'know?\n", "I\u2019m talking about you. You big, big freak.\n": "Oh.  Ohh. Ohh, you\u2019re out of your mind.\n", "I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.\n": " Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...\n", "You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and  especially last night...\n": " Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech... \n", "Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!\n": " Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!\n", "Yeah...\n... is it weird that it's not with each other?\n": "Yeah! A little bit, yeah...\n", "Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year! \n": " Hey, you guys!\n", "Oh yes, it is. I'm sorry I borrowed it, I was cold. I hope its okay?\n": "Well uh, it's just that uh, y'know if-if you're gonna be wearing someone's sweatshirt shouldn't it be your boyfriends--and I\u2019m not him.\n", "I'm sorry, I'll give it back to you.\n": "No-no! No! I mean it's gonna be all smelling like Monica!\n", "Are you saying I smell bad?\n": "No! No, you smell like a meadow.  I'm sorry. \n", "Wait a minute, wait. You\u2019re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn\u2019t want you back?!\n": "Yeah! Oh my God!  Is this what it\u2019s like to be you?\n", "Wow, you\u2019re really crazy about her, huh?\n": "Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we\u2019re on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it\u2019s like somebody\u2019s ripping out my heart!\n", "Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.\n": "Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?\n", "Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?\n": "Who knows?\n", "Yes!! I knew it!!  Bye-bye! So long! Later!\n": "Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!\n", "Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two  or you two.  \n": "Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.\n", "I\ufffdm starving. I know we were coming here tonight, I ate  nothing all day.\n": "What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.\n", "Right. We do have a table for two available, perhaps you would  be more comfortable.\n": "No, they\ufffdre comin\ufffd, we\ufffdre waitin\ufffd right here.\n", "Come on Phoebe, let\u2019s go! Come on, it\u2019s time to get serious, huddle up. Joey, keep your head in the game.\n": "It\u2019s hard, y'know, his huddle is closer to Dutch girl.\n", "All right look, if I take Chandler out of the running will you be able to focus?\n": "What are you gonna do?\n", "All right, you just make sure that Chandler catches the ball, I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\n": "Okay.\n", "Break!\n": "Here you go!\n", "No-no-no-no, the game\u2019s not over, we\u2019re just switching teams.\n": "Yeah, Chandler finds me so intimdating that it\u2019s better if we\u2019re on the same team.\n", "No ah, hold on a second Joe, where do Dutch people come from?\n": "Ah well, the ah, Pennsylvania Dutch, come from Pennsylvania.\n", "And the other ah, Dutch people, they come on from somewhere near the Netherlands, right?\n": "Nice try.  See the Netherlands is this make believe place where Peter Pan and Tinker Bell come from.\n", "Enough with geography for the insane, okay? Let\u2019s play some ball, guys.\n": "Whoa, whoa, no, no, I-I\u2019m not playing with this guy, now.\n", "I now find you shallow and um, a dork. All right, bye.\n": "Nice going. You just saved yourself a couple months of sex.\n", "Hey! It\u2019s 42-21!\n": "This sucks, I was just up by that much!\n", "I\u2019m sorry, they were just all coming at me, and I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n": " Thirty seconds left on the timer!\n", "Yeah, right.\n": "I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.\n", "Get out.\n": "I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.\n", "Really? You don't know what that means to me.\n": "Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?\n", " Nothing.\n": "Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?\n", "Yeah.  Oh.\n": "What's wrong?\n", "I just remembered, I have to do something.\n": "Oh. What?\n", "Who in the hell are you?\n": "I guess you wouldn\u2019t believe me if I said I was Kurt Douglas, huh?\n", "Put some pants on kid so I can kick your butt.\n": "No-no-no, no, no, wait. You see, I\u2019m an actor, Joey Tribbiani, I\u2019m doing a scene with you today, and well, I stink.\n", " You\u2019re in this picture?\n": "Yeah-yeah, I\u2019m one of the cops that won\u2019t work with you \u2018cause you a lose cannon. Anyway, look, I\u2019m really sorry, but I stink!\n", "Joey, right?\n": "Yeah.\n", " Every actor at one time or another\u2014opp!  Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford won\u2019t even watch himself.\n": "Oh no-no-no, you don\u2019t understand\u2026\n", "Listen to me!\n": "Oh yeah, yeah.\n", "I don\u2019t know one actor worth his salt that didn\u2019t say at one time or another, \"God, I stink!\" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!\n": "Yes sir! Yes sir, I\u2019m-I\u2019m\u2014\n", "So uh, any ideas for the bachelor party yet?\n": "Whoa-whoa-whoa! Before you start handing out wedding rings and planning bachelor parties, don\u2019t you have to decide who your best man is gonna be?\n", "I sort\u2019ve already asked Chandler.\n": "What?! He got to do it at your first wedding!\n", "Joey, I figured you\u2019d understand. I mean, I-I\u2019ve known him a lot longer.\n": "Come on Ross! Look, I-I don\u2019t have any brothers; I\u2019ll never get to be a best man!\n", "You can be the best man when I get married.\n": " I\u2019ll never get to be a best man!\n", "Oh no-no-no, you\u2014yeah, of course you get to be my best man.\n": " What about me?! You-you just said I could!\n", "I\u2019m not even getting married! Okay, this is a question for science fiction writers!\n": "I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re not picking me.\n", " Hey, that kid looks familiar.\n": "Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad\u2026.\n", "Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you, \n": "That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?\n", "Joey, you look nothing like Ben.\n": "I look more like him than you do! \n", "So, you and Rachel tonight, huh?\n": "Yeah. It's actually our first official date \n", "Wow! So tonight may be the night! You're nervous?\n": "Naa, no. This is the part I'm actually good at.\n", "What must it be like not to be crippled by fear   and self-loathing.\n": " It's OK!\n", "How can you be so confident?\n": "Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!\n", "Really? Like you have a routine?\n": "No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have   to appreciate their uniqueness.\n", "You mean like this? \n": "NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. \n", "Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. \n": "More foosball?\n", "So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this? \n": "...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody? \n", "Well, I-I could live without it. \n": "Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? \n", "Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. \n": "Oh,  \"you do, do you\"? \n", "Yeah, well I don\u2019t think you can make that statement, unless you\u2019ve been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.\n": "Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that\u2019s all. I mean, come on, it\u2019s just a little wax.\n", "Oh, that\u2019s mature.\n": "Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?\n", "Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!\n": "Y'know what, I don\u2019t think we should listen to this anymore. \n", " What, what are you doing? You can\u2019t go out there.\n": "Why not?!  I\u2019m hungry.\n", "Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.\n": "Yeah, we\u2019ll be fine.\n", "Order a pizza like, \u2018I forgive you?\u2019\n": "Oh man, pizza? I like pizza.  Put olives on the pizza.\n", "What if they don\u2019t?\n": "You think I need a new walk?\n", "What, now you\u2019re not even taking to me?  Look Rachel, I-I\u2019m sorry, okay, I\u2019m sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I\u2019d lost you, I didn\u2019t know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don\u2019t cheat right, I, that\u2019s not me, I\u2019m not Joey!\n": "Whoa-ho-ho!  Yeah, okay.\n", "Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants.   Bird feces.\n": "Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now   they're gone!\n", "Oh God! What did I just step on?\n": "Oh!\n", "Oh..\n": "You stepped on my egg roll?\n", "I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the    floor.\n": "Just put it on a plate and leave.\n", "Okay, let's find these birds.\n": "Alright.\n", "Well, that can't be good!\n": "We gotta get them out of there!\n", "How?\n": "Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?\n", "Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.\n": "Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.\n", "Joey, wait! The ball!\n": "Oh!\n", "I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.\n": "Okay.\n", "No... It's all glued together.\n": "Does that mean we have to bust it open?\n", "I don't know. Maybe.\n": "Oh my God!\n", "I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.\n": "All right, you know what? We don't have a choice. It's like I would    have said in that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part. \"Those are our    men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the    most important thing in my life; my time-machine.\"\n", "Did that movie ever get made?\n": "It did not.\n", "Noo!! The point is that is was you that was there that night! It is you that I am marrying! It is you that I feel in love with!\n": "And it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv\u2014\n", "Chandler, please! Do you know how unbelievably glad I am that Joey was not there that night?!\n": "Hey!  Now I\u2019m a man of the cloth, but I still have feelings!\n", " Look there is no way you\u2019re doing this wedding now. Okay?\n": "What?! That\u2019s not fair! It\u2019s not my fault! I was off with my bride\u2019s maid! And who\u2019s to say I would\u2019ve even said yes?!  I mean I would\u2019ve said yes. Chandler look y-y-you are making way to big a deal out of this, all right? Look, everything worked out okay!\n", "It is to me. You wanted to sleep with Batman, and instead you had to settle for Robin. \n": "This is crazy.\n", "Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...\n": "But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?\n", " No.\n": "There it is, you're blushing!\n", "No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.\n": "You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it? \n", "Joey! \n": "Whoa-whoa-hey-hey!  Hi, Paul is it? \n", "Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.\n": "What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?\n", "Oh!  Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?\n": " Yeah, who is that?\n", "Do ya?\n": "Yeah.\n", " I just left you a message! Ross and I were gonna go grab a bite, but now that you're here, maybe we can go have that dinner.\n": "Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?\n", "I had a great time.\n": "Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...\n", "So, shall we?\n": "Yeah. \n", "Peel the onion. First of all, he\u2019s good looking.\n": "Yeah.\n", "I think my character\u2019s gonna need a little bit more of reason than that.\n": "Oh, hey, how about this one. Ah, it\u2019s says so in the script! Y'know ah, I-I don\u2019t know why my character likes you either, I mean it says in the script here that you\u2019re a bitch.\n", "Hey Joey!\n": "Erin! Still here!\n", "Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!\n": "Why wouldn\u2019t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there\u2019s you guys.\n", "Bye Joey.  Last night was fun.\n": "Yeah. I\u2019ll uh, I\u2019ll call ya.\n", "And call me!\n": " Okay, good to see you again.\n", "We want you to marry her!\n": "What?!!\n", "She is so amazing! You have no idea.\n": "No idea? Who do you think brought her here?\n", "Joey, she\u2019s so cool. She speaks four languages.\n": "Man, do you know what guys want!\n", "Look Joey, come on she\u2019s so perfect for you! I mean she\u2019s sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.\n": "My beers?! Look you guys, she\u2019s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just\u2014I don\u2019t see it going anywhere.\n", "Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.\n": "Look I\u2019m sorry you guys, I-I just don\u2019t think so.\n", "Fine. \n": "Hey, don\u2019t start judging me!  Huh? You\u2019re the one who\u2019s in love with her assistant!  Huh? And you, you\u2019re the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!\n", "Wow! Nice! Manly and also kind of a slut.\n": "Y\u2019know, I\u2019m beginning to see what Jake was talking about.\n", "Uh-huh.\n": "I still haven\u2019t gotten a check for your half yet.\n", "Huh.\n": "Yeah! And-and things aren\u2019t as\u2026smashed down as I thought they were gonna be.\n", "That\u2019s great Joe!\n": "Yeah! And you have so many more choices than you do with men\u2019s underwear!\n", "Hey, that was really good! \n": "Thanks! Let's keep going. \n", "Okay. \"So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?\" \n": "\"I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.\" \n", "\"Smoke away.\" \nI think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. \n": "What? \n", "Not so much! \n": "Whoah! \n", "Hey! \n": "Hey! \n", "Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. \n": "No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. \n", "Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. \n": "Y'miss it? \n", " Let\u2019s get you into wardrobe for a fitting.\n": "Okay. Hey uh, when do I get to meet the robot?\n", "I\u2019m sorry, why don\u2019t we do that right now? He\u2019s right here. \n": "Okay.\n", "Joey Tribbiani, this is\u2026\n": "Oh wow!

Sorry about that\u2026 Uh, so where\u2019s C.H.E.E.S.E.?\n", " Nice to meet you Mac!\n": " This is like the temporary robot, right?\n", "No. Why?\n": "Well, I-I just, I just it was going to be like a really cool robot, y\u2019know? Like the terminator or uh, when I first saw you.\n", "I spent two years developing this machine, it\u2019s absolutely state of the art.\n": "I\u2019m sorry, it just\u2014I don\u2019t know it doesn\u2019t really look like it can do anything.\n", "So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the wedding, do you need one?\n": "No, I\u2019m performing the ceremony.

Oh-oh! \n", "What are you doing?!\n": "It\u2019s still a tiny bit on fire there.\n", "So good!\n": "Suck-fest.\n", "I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...\n": "Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.\n", "There was nudity!\n": "I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.\n", "You wouldn\u2019t happen to have a very big fork?\n": "So I uh, I just talked to the director. That\u2019s it, we\u2019re done for the day.\n", "Well have we finished the scene?\n": "Yeah! You\u2026you were wonderful.\n", "As were you.\n": "So I got your car, it\u2019s right outside.\n", "Why? Are we done for the day?\n": "That\u2019s what you told me.\n", "Oh, thank you. You\u2019re welcome. \n": "No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on!  Here we go.\n", "Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.\n": "Feminist issue. That's where I went!\n", "I know! My God! Do you have your speech?\n": "Yeah, I got my speech!\n", "Do you got your gracious loser face?\n": "Yeah. \n", "Now Joey remember, if you win you have to hug me! You hug me!\n": "Okay. Can I squeeze your ass?\n", "On TV?! Yeah!\n": "\u2018Kay! \n", "Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.\n": " Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?\n", "That was you?! I thought it was Jack!\n": "No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!\n", "What?! Why does she think that?\n": "Because it kinda looked like I did.\n", "Again, what?!\n": "Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand\u2026\n", "As we all are at some point during the day.\n": "It wasn\u2019t my ring! It fell out of Ross\u2019s jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!\n", "Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?\n": "I guess.\n", "And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!\n": "I know! I know it\u2019s awful.\n", "Well, what did she say?\n": " She said yes.\n", "Does Ross know?\n": "Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?\n", "Well maybe you don\u2019t have to tell him anything.\n": "Oh, I like that. Yeah\u2026\n", "If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!\n": " Now let\u2019s not get carried away. \n", " I\u2019m a good person. And I\u2019m a good chef, and I don\u2019t deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Y\u2019know what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do is\u2026\n": " Hey! Chef Geller! Y\u2019know that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!\n", "You do?\n": "You bet I do! I just ah, wasn\u2019t listening then, that\u2019s all.\n", "Well if you want a problem? I\u2019ll give you a problem!\n": "What are you gonna do? You\u2019re gonna fire me?\n", "Look out kids, he\u2019s coming! \n": "And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.\n", "Have fun. Oh wait, no, don\u2019t! I forgot I am totally against that now.\n": "What? Me having a job?\n", "No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights.  Hey, how do you sleep at night?\n": "Well, I\u2019m pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.\n", "Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that\u2019s, I think that\u2019s really cool.\n": "Yeah, Rach, I think you\u2019re handling that really well.\n", "Nothing.\n": "I am\u2026  free!\n", " This would be the place where you explain the hat.\n": "Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.\n", "And you're gonna make them all disappear.\n": "Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.\n", "Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.\n": "Great! Thanks, Rach!\n", "Sure!  God, please take those off!\n": "All right. \n", "Is everything okay?\n": "Are you all right?\n", "Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.\n": "Pheebs! Sorry!\n", "Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.\n": "Pheebs, I'm so sorry.\n", "Oh my god...\n": "Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!\n", "I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.\n": "Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?\n", "Monica.\n": "Got ya. \n", "I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.\n": "Mine's is to Lilian Myers.\n", "So, I\u2019m in my apartment doing the Soap Opera Digest crossword puzzle, and guess who the clue is for three down. \n": " Three down, Days Of Our Lives star blank Tribbiani. That\u2019s me!! I\u2019m blank!!\n", "How cool is this?! We know three down! I\u2019m touching three down! \n": "Yeah you are baby.\n", "So did they call you to tell you your name\u2019s gonna be in this?\n": "No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.\n", "Why\u2019d you say no?\n": "Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.\n", "Okay, don\u2019t listen to him. Please?\n": "Fine! All right, I\u2019ll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y\u2019know, start to say something stupid.\n", "Come on! We will be there for you the whole time! Just remember gal pal Rachel Green.  Ha-ha! I\u2019m gonna be in Soap Opera Digest! And not just in the dumb crossword puzzle.  Seriously, proud of you.\n": "Yeah.\n", "Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.\n": "Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.\n", " You're kinda stepping on the song. \n": "Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.\n", "...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, \"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!\"\n": " Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?\n", "Oh, I like my job.\n": "I *love* my job.\n", "The game's over! Take off your robe!\n": " Ok... I mean...\n", "And the ring, was the size of my fist !\n": "Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker\u2019s a nice guy and I\u2019d like to get to know him.\n", "Then you better do it now.\n": "Why?\n", "Because I\u2019m going to kill him\n": "What-what? \n", "You guys were right. He\u2019s just too excited about\u2026everything. I mean I\u2019m all for living life, but this is the Geller\u2019s 35th anniversary. Okay? Let\u2019s call a spade a spade this party stinks.\n": "I know I\u2019m having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!\n", "Are you sure it wasn\u2019t an oyster?\n": "I guess it could\u2019ve been, I didn\u2019t really look at it. Y\u2019know, I just wiped it on Chandler\u2019s coat and got the hell out of there.\n", "He\u2019s just such a great guy I\u2019m so excited about him.\n": "Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There\u2019s nothing wrong with him he\u2019s a good guy. \n", "You think?\n": "Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!\n", "You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right, he\u2019s just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I\u2019m a sunny, positive person. \n": "Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.\n", "What\u2019s that now?\n": "Nothing\u2026\n", "Let\u2019s reset.\n": "What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!\n", " Are you a little off today? It\u2019s going terribly slowly.\n": "Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I\u2019m the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?\n", "Of course! I\u2019m-I\u2019m sorry. I-I\u2019d hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!\n": "Thank you. Thank you.\n", "Still rolling, annnnd action!\n": "I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!\n", "Uh, yeah, I\u2019ll take a coffee. Thanks, man.\n": "Sure.  Coffee? \u2018Cause I\u2019m going up there. \n", "No, thank you.\n": " You guys need anything, \u2018cause I\u2019m heading up there. \n", "I\u2019d love an ice water.\n": "You got it.\n", "Joey, what are you doing?\n": "Just what needs to be done! Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman\u2026\n", "Joey, honey, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to go back there.\n": "Nah, it\u2019s okay. Right, Gunther? \n", "Don\u2019t wink at me. And put on your apron.\n": "Okay, but I don\u2019t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons. \n", "Joey, do you work here?\n": "No.\n", "I thought I was a complete idiot.\n": "Hey, I\u2019m with you. He even asked me if I thought you\u2019d go out with him.\n", "Oh! Oh, I think I\u2019m gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?\n": "I said no.\n", "Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?\n": "I didn\u2019t tell him. I didn\u2019t know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.\n", "Good-good, don\u2019t tell him. Don\u2019t tell him. Just have him call me okay?\n": "Rach look, I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a great\u2026\n", "You know sometimes your words... they hurt.\n": "Hey uh, where do you guys want this?\n", "Right. Except that I do want to get married.\n": " Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?\n", "Actually, me too.\n": "Are you serious?!\n", "So you guys want coffees?\n": "Yeah, but uh, I don\u2019t want to be up too late, so uh, I\u2019ll have a decaf. \n", "Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?\n": "I can\u2019t hear a word you\u2019re saying, my ears are ringing so bad.\n", "I\u2019m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y\u2019know? I used them as mittens, I didn\u2019t want to touch a thing in that last place.\nHow sad are we?\n": "Yeah, I know.\n", "Joey, you\u2019re this guy\u2019s teacher. I mean how could you do this?\n": "Because, Monica, the guy\u2019s so good, and I really, really want this part.\n", "It\u2019s not a date, okay. I\u2019m just gonna teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has.\n": "Well, you might wanna make a little extra, y'know you\u2019ll probably be hungry after the sex.\n", "I wanna see what\u2019s in your hand. I wanna see the trash. \n": "Yeah.\n", "Richard was there so I couldn\u2019t do it!\n": "What?! Noooo\u2026 \n", "I\u2019m gonna do it tomorrow y\u2019know, and-and surprise her, but now you\u2019ve ruined it!\n": "We didn\u2019t ruin it!\n", "Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor\u2026\n": "Glove salesman!\n", "I can do that, I\u2019ve had 30 years of practice.\n": "Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! \n", " I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!\n": "That guy\u2019s still doing that?!\n", "Yeah! Oh yeah, you\u2019ll be fine! It-it\u2019ll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y\u2019know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won\u2019t.\n": "What if I smack my head on the concrete?\n", "Well, I\u2019m gonna lie to you Joey, it\u2019s a possibility.\n": " I don\u2019t know Ross! I-I tell you what, let\u2019s flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?\n", "Oh, all right.  Tails!  Can you-can you see what it is?\n": "No.\n", "Okay. Well, you be careful.\n": "What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I\u2019m not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can\u2019t go if I break my leg.\n", "Huh, I never really noticed.\n": "Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.\n", "How come?\n": "Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and    I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.\n", "What do you do with your money now?\n": "Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank.     I didn't say that! It's in    a bank guarded by robots!\n", "Do you have any ideas?\n": "Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going    in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping    to plant the emus...\n", "Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.\n": " Yeah! Right!  People eat    birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you    go to a restaurant and you say: \"Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried    bird.\"  Or... or maybe just a wing or... \n", "Joey, I think you should consider something a little    less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The    Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible.     That's right, I know some stuff!\n": "Real estate, huh? Hmmm...\n", "Are you all right?!\n": "Yeah...\n", " What happened?!!\n": " Awww, man! He promised he wouldn\u2019t take the chairs!!\n", "What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!\n": "Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn\u2019t think big enough to fit a grown man!\n", "So\u2014You got in voluntarily?!\n": "I was tryin\u2019 to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I\u2019m gonna do?\n", "No time for that!\n": "Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!\n", "Well, I\u2019ve got a girl in here.\n": "No you don\u2019t, I just saw you go in there with Monica!\n", "Well, we\u2019re-we\u2019re hanging out in here!\n": "Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?\n", "Oh, my new Mom, who-who\u2019s a big, fat abandoner! \n": "Whoa, wait, Pheebs, wait a second! Don\u2019t you wanna stay here and talk about it?\n", "Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won\u2019t work out.\n": "Wow.\n", "I know. Then, I\u2019m gonna marry Chandler for the money and you\u2019ll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.\n": "Great!\n", "But then we ditch those two and that\u2019s when we get married. We\u2019ll have Chandler\u2019s money and Rachel\u2019s kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel\u2019s drinking problem.\n": "Oh-oh, what about Ross?\n", "Yes, Denise. Denise! \n": "Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?\n", "Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!\n": "Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin\u2019 uh, I\u2019m gonna have an extra room over at my place\u2026\n", "Oh, that\u2019s true.\n": "Yeah, why don\u2019t you move in with me? It\u2019ll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday\u2019s right?\n", "Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that\u2019s gonna cost extra. Okay, here\u2019s the extras, handcuffs, spanking\u2026 \n": "Maybe Monica\u2019s playing a joke on ya. Y\u2019know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that\u2019s pretty funny.\n", "That is funny, maybe for my birthday she\u2019ll murder someone.\n": "I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.\n", "I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!\n": "Are you kidding? I love that guy!  Morning\u2019s here! Morning is here\u2014\n", "Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference   with Charlie.\n": "I understand...\n", "Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really   good time to talk to him.\n": "I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.\n", "Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done,   they'll probably be serving dinner.\n": "Ooh...\n", "Still nervous?\n": "I'm gonna get the lasagna.\n", "So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.\n": "Yeah?\n", "Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry   to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and...,   well...\n": "You kissed.\n", "Wha...  What? What would give you that idea?\n": "I saw you.\n", "Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else   happened, okay.\n": "Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.\n", "Are you serious?\n": "Yeah... Now I have something...\n", "I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put   my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know   that?\n": "Oh... uh...  look... before you...\n", "No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless,   and generous...\n": "I am those things, yeah.\n", "You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always   think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some   stuff...\n": "Dude!\n", "Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...\n": "I can't think of anything.\n", "Excuse me!  You didn't tell him, did you?\n": "I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things   about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge   on Chandler.\n", "Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget   it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.\n": "Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.\n", "And I hope it\u2019s not an inappropriate time to say this but, you\u2019re the best sex I ever had.\n": "That\u2019s always appropriate!  Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!\n", " Joey! Joey!\n": "What? What\u2019s going on?\n", "Come feel this! Come feel my belly!\n": "Aaaah\u2026\n", "Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!\n": "Really?!\n", "Oh, okay! \n": "Oh my, oh my God!\n", "Aw, it\u2019s unbelievable! Wow! She is kicking so much! Oh, she\u2019s like umm\u2026oh\u2026who\u2019s that kind of annoying girl soccer player?\n": "Mia Hamm?\n", "Mia Hamm!\n": "Oh that\u2019s amazing. \n", "What the hell are you doing?\n": "What? What the hell am I doing? You just broke my fridge!\n", "Well, we're not.\n": "But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!\n", "We don't have a code word.\n": "We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word    for danger.\n", "  Some people    don't    get him, but I think he's really funny! .\n": " I did not care for that!\n", " You have to get out of here. You slept    with    our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so    she can't    see you.\n": "Ok, ok! \n", "Ok!\nWhat?\n": "I forgot my bat.\n", "What are you doing here?\n": " Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!\n", "I can explain... Joey...\n": "Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back    here. I can't believe you never called me.\n", "I gave you my number, you never called me.\n": "No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of...    social work, ok, that you can just... do.\n", " Well, I'm pretty sure I gave    you my number.\n": "Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny,    we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?\n", "I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...\n": "No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You    know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you? \n", "Joey, wait!\n": " NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore... \n", "Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going    to make excellent parents.\n": "LAURA! \n", "What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!\n": "Hey, it's not like it sounds.\n", "You can\u2019t do that!\n": "If he goes first he can!\n", "Whatever Ross! Just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you\u2019re done.\n": " Hey!\n", "Look Rach if-if you want to go for a ride in the Porsche I\u2019ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block.\n": "Yeah, you got a couple hours?\n", "Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!\n": " Those two only had each other!\n", "Oh yeah! I saw her walkin\u2019 it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.\n": "Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin\u2019 it by the park.\n", "Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?\n": "Hey Pheebs?\n", "Okay, come on\u2014Joey, I\u2019ll buy you a new one! All right? We\u2019ll go down to the store right now and we\u2019ll-we\u2019ll get you a new chair.\n": " She\u2019s not even cold yet!\n", "But don\u2019t you think Rosita would\u2019ve wanted you to move on? I mean y\u2019know, she did always put\u2026your comfort first.\n": "That\u2019s true.\n", "Estelle? Why?\n": "There\u2019s a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I    didn\u2019t even be put up for it! She\u2019d better have a good reason.\n", "Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you    will wait a minute before you call her.\n": "Ok. Why?\n", "Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.    \n": "I love that saying!\n", "Joey, it\u2019s Estelle.\n": "I was just gonna call you! That\u2019s weird.\n", "It\u2019s a little coincidental, but believable.    . Listen, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering why    I didn\u2019t get you an audition for that TV movie.\n": "Yeah, actually I am!\n", "I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!  \n": "That\u2019s it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.\n", "Don\u2019t take that tone with me. Who you    think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?\n": "No, no, look. All I\u2019m saying is that you\u2019re my agent, ok?    And you\u2019re not getting me into any auditions and I\u2019m tired of it.\n", "What are you saying?\n": "I\u2019m saying that\u2026 . This isn't  working for me    anymore, ok?

Let me help you with that.\n", "I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!\n": "Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song,    maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!  Phoebe: So you\u2019re gonna... hit on her?\nNo, no, no!

Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!\n", "Why?\n": "Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.\n", "No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.\n": "Yeah!\n", "Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.\n": "Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!\n", "My God! \n": " Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?\n", "Joey! He\u2019s working!  You would look good in that.\n": "Oh, how bad is it?\n", "Do you ah, currently own a set of encyclopedias? \n": "No!

It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?\n", "Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.\n": "Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the    world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.\n", "Joey, this is awkward part.\n": "Oh! Hey right! Not a problem.  I totally understand. You need to y\u2019know make sure I don\u2019t have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don\u2019t you worry; I have nothing to hide.  So there you go, that\u2019s me.  One hundred percent natural!

Do we have any thoughts here?\n": "Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right. But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear. It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building! If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug. Right.

You may be confused by this now,  but you won\u2019t be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let\u2019s get started before the groom takes off again. Huh?  We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I\u2019ve known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I\u2019ve left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?\n", "Chandler, for so long I\u2026I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I\u2019d ever been looking for my whole life. And now\u2026here we are\u2026with our future before us\u2026and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don\u2019t want to. You go!\n": "Chandler?\n", " No, that\u2019s okay.  Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it\u2019s okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I\u2019m sure? \n": "You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?\n", "I do.\n": "I now pronounce you... husband and wife.\n", "Rings?\n": "Aw crap! Okay\u2014uh\u2026uh let\u2019s-let\u2019s do the rings. \nWe good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife.  Now kiss her again.\n", " Okay, I know I\u2019m not supposed to know, but I do. And I\u2019m so excited for you!\n": "What? What\u2019s going on?\n", "Monica\u2019s pregnant!\n": "Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!\n", "Guys! I\u2019m not pregnant.\n": "Ah.  Slow swimmers? \n", " Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.\n": "I can\u2019t! I-I don\u2019t have any other clothes here.\n", "I don\u2019t\u2014Look I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re complaining about now?

And that they can make their own decisions.\n": "No they can\u2019t! They were stupid enough to get knocked up!\n", "He\u2019s not here right now.\n": "Oh, you\u2019re kidding me! All-all right, well make sure you tell him that Joey Tribbiani stopped by to drop off all of these clothes. Okay?

And that\u2019s what this ring stands for.\n", "But I thought that ring stood for Caprice\u2019s undying love for her brother.\n": "Look, do you want the ring or not?!\n", "That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!\n": "Hi! How are the Gellers? \n", "Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.\n": "I'm Joey Tribbiani.\n", "Well, as much as I\u2019d like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren\u2019t going to be here. All right? I mean, she\u2019s going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I\u2019ve got a whole special evening planned. So I\u2019m sorry, no party.\n": "Awwww!\n", "Like what?\n": "What-what-what is so funny?\n", "I said, \"Like what?\"\n": "Now that\u2019s a thinker.\n", "Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?\n": "A little salami. \n", "Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?\n": "Pastrami. \n", "Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?\n": "Yeah. \n", "Ohh, God! Look at him, he\u2019s so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?\n": "Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.\n", "Flashdance.\n": "Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl\u2026\n", "She was a welder.\n": "What? Were you like in the movie, or\u2026 Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.\n", "Yay!\n": " Hey! Is the show still on?\n", " Okay, that-that\u2019s enough! Y\u2019know, let\u2019s, let\u2019s let someone else play.\n": "If you didn\u2019t want to play, why did you come to the party?\n", "Come on over the years none of you ever y'know, got drunk and stupid.\n": "Well, that\u2019s really a different question.\n", "I\u2019m sorry I find it hard to believe that a group of people who spends as much time together as you guys do has never bumped uglies.\n": "Well, there was that one time that Monica and Rachel got together.\n", "Excuse me, there was no time!\n": "Okay, but let\u2019s say there was. How might that go?\n", "Yeah, I\u2019ll take some.\n": "Hey, there\u2019s a dog out there!\n", " You knew about this?\n": "Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.\n", "I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!\n": "Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.\n", "Chandler-\n": "Me neither, y'know what-\n", "I'm still mad at you for not telling me.\n": "What are you mad at me for?!\n", "You gotta let me slam the door! \n": " Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did!  See what happens when you break the code?\n", "I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something,    you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.\n": "Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE    TIME!\n I've been here the whole time!\n", " Hey, you made it into a bunny.\n": "What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it    was a penis. \n", "My first time with Carol was...  \n": "What? \n", "It was my first time. \n": "With Carol?  Oh. \n", "Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart       from the great food.\n": "I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with       her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.\n", "Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.\n": "Why are they doing this?\n", "I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.\n": "You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in       here?\n", "I just wish they'd realise they should be together.\n": "I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know,       that's where things were headed.\n", "I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have       more children.\n": "Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have       kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.\n", "You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's       out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.\n": "Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck!       But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.\n", "So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them       up with people?\n": "I know; that just pushes them further and further apart. \n", "Yeah.  Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel       up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.\n": "Ooh, that's a great plan! \n", " Hi guys!\n": "Hey!\n", "Oh, just hanging out, talkin\u2019 about uh, websites.  Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.\n": " Yeah, Big Brother.\n", "Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!\n": "Takes it out of you? \n", " She was working on Valentine\u2019s Day so we\u2019re celebrating it tonight.\n": "Ohh, hey! Why don\u2019t you book a date for both of you at one of those romantic spas?\n", "Ooh, Joey, that\u2019s actually a really good idea!\n": "And of course, crotchless panties. \n", "You guys!\n": "You can\u2019t make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cut\u2026\n", "Why two?\n": "Because it\u2019s faster.\n", "Okay, one...two...\n": "So we are going on two?\n", "Oh, good job Joe.\n": "Wow, it\u2019s big!\n", "Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller! \n": "Maybe, my ruler\u2019s wrong.\n", "Maybe all the rulers are wrong.\n": "Look it\u2019s not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.\n", "Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you   out?\n": "\n", " Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah,   that would be nice.\n": "Look at this. My two best friends!\n", "So, if you\u2019re parents hadn\u2019t got divorced, you\u2019d be able to answer a question like a normal person?\n": "Look, I just need a wire something to jimmy it. Oh hey, one of you guys give me the underwire from your bra!\n", "Please!!\n": "Whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra, therefore has the biggest wire.\n", "No, not getting my bra!\n": "If you wanna get back in the car, we need the wire, your call.\n", " Okay, there.\n": "Thank you Phoebe, that is very, very generous.\n", "Okay, now let\u2019s decide who has the nicest ass.\n": " And there you go!\n", "Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap.  Umm, this one is made of bologna. \n": "And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?\n", "Oh, just until the glue dries.\n": "Thank God!\n", " Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable. \n": "Ah.\n", "Okay?  Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it\u2019s gonna shrink.\n": "Well maybe we just take that one away. \n", "I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that\u2019s really just for me.  Okay. So, why don\u2019t you go into your room and try these on and we\u2019ll see\u2014get a better idea of what\u2019s gonna work.\n": "Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.\nOw!\n", "Toothpick?\n": "Yeah.\n", "What are you trying on now?\n": "The fruit roll up.\n", "And?\n": "I\u2019m out.\n", "Lying is wrong!\n": "And?... AND?\n", "Because I cared enough to lie!\n": "Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how you\u2019d handle maid of honor type situations.\n", "Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?\n": "Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.\n", "Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio. \n": "Hi.\n", "Just uh, brought back your videos.\n": "Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.\n", "No! No we don\u2019t!\n": "Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!! \n", "I\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\n": "Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!\n", "I\u2019ve had better.\n": "Okay! When?!\n", "All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!\n": "Uh-huh!\n", "I\u2019ve said it! Okay?! But it\u2019s over Joey!\n": "I want to do it again.\n", "We can\u2019t do it again.\n": "Why not?\n", "Because it\u2019s weird!\n": "Fine! Do you want something to drink?\n", "We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.\n": "Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.\n", " Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!\n": " You didn\u2019t cry when Bambi\u2019s mother died?\n", "No, I guess I just never really cried. Y\u2019know? I\u2019m not a crying kind of guy.\n": "Come on man there\u2019s gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?\n", "I\u2019d be sad sure, but I wouldn\u2019t cry.\n": "Okay, what if the puppy said, \"Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me.\"\n", " I love your car.\n": "Yeah, it\u2019s  mine.\n", "I bet it\u2019s fast.\n": "Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?\n", "No I don\u2019t think so.\n": "Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, she\u2019s real, uh, mellow!\n", "Look, are you dating this girl you came with?\n": "Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you know\u2026\n", "No, no. She\u2019s fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!\n": "Alright, alright, hey y\u2019know fair is fair,  if you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, what can I say, but hey oh no! \n", "Namaste. \nOh my God! What happened to the door?!\n": "So it\u2019s noticeable huh?\n", "Yeah but uh\u2026 Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept together, but there\u2019s something else.  Rachel\u2019s pregnant.\n": " Oh my God!!! I can\u2019t believe that!!\n", "A little bit.\n": "How are you doing?\n", "Okay. Okay. I mean I\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019s just I don\u2019t think I handled it very well.\n": "Well, what did you say to her?\n", "But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.\n": " What?\n", "I gotta go find her.\n": "Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they don\u2019t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!\n", " What, is everything ok?\n": "Uh... Charlie and I broke up.\n", "Nooooo, why?\n": "Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.\n", " Oh, that's crazy!\n": "No, it's not, we have nothing in common!\n", "... yeah, it's true.\n": "I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!\n", " What, hey!\n": " Ok, Rach!\nI feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?\n", "W-What are you, what are you talking about?\n": "Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like...  What the hell is my problem? OH! \n", "Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...\n": " I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!\n", "Yeah, I'm not talking about her...\n": "But then who? The waitress I went out with last month? \n", "You know? Forget it!\n": " No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?\n", "No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!\n": "Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!\n", "No one! They are my friends, I wouldn\u2019t punch any of them.\n": "Chandler?\n", "wonderful time!\n": "Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!\n", "I know!\n": "I\u2019ll get it. \n", "Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.\n": "I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so\n", "Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.\n": "Huh. Huh.\n", "leaves, but you live here. I\u2019m ripping into this swan.\n": "Ah! Okay, well then you don\u2019t judge me. I\u2019m gonna suck on the\n", "So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani\u2019s end of the night moves?\n": "Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips\n", "How do you do that?\n": "Now you can\u2019t tell anyone, but uh\u2026I put on shiny lip balm.\n", "No, I don\u2019t want to tell you.\n": "Why not?\n", "Because it\u2019s embarrassing.\n": "More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! (Rachel just looks at\n", "like anything, but I swear it works.\n": " Yeah. Why\u2014Yeah, that would work for ya\u2026\n", "All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.\n": "Oh.  Yeah.  Me to. (He then\n", "Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?\n": "Right. No big deal.\n", "What code?\n": "You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!\n", "Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.\n": "Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.\n", "No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.\n": "Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.\n", "Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.\n": "Ross, how could you let this happen?\n", "I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...\n": "You don't think my mom's sexy?\n", "Well... not in the same way...\n": "I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?\n", "Well, not playing raquetball!\n": "He forgot to leave his grip size!\n", "Do they wait for me to do this?\n": "So are you gonna tell him?\n", "Why would I tell him?\n": "How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.\n", " What are you guys doing here?\n": "Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!\n", "Oh, you\u2019re sweet and cute.\n": "I know! That\u2019s why they trashed me!\nWhoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute.\n", "What? So you never went out with an actress before?\n": "Kate, do you even like me?\n", "Of course I do.\n": "Well so, how come you blew me off? Y'know? How come you were with him?\n", "I don\u2019t know! I just, just do this! I-I always have to pick the like the smartest guy, or-or the most talented guy\u2026 Why can\u2019t I just pick someone like you?\n": "Thanks.\n", "They're male nurses.\n": "Not in my head.\n", "Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.\n": " Yep! There's always room for Jell-O\u2026\n", " Good for me! \n": "Y'okay, Phoebe? \n", "Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. \n": "What are you talking about? Keep it! \n", "'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. \n": "So when do we get to meet the guy? \n", "You\u2019re just saying that because you\u2019re my biggest fan.   Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay?  He\u2019s a fan.  Bye! \n": " So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?\n", "I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. But I, but I just got Phoebe Buffay\u2019s autograph!\n": "Oh, you\u2019re Phoebe\u2019s fan!\n", "Oh yeah! I\u2019ve seen all her movies.\n": "Movies?\n", "That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.\n": " I don\u2019t think so.\n", "No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren\u2019t gonna believe this! \n": "Hey Gunther, don\u2019t let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe\u2019s a porn star!\n", "Joey, you're so sweet.\n": "That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.\n", "What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.\n": " Hey guys.\n", "Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?\n": "No, thank you.\n", "Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.\n": "But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.\n", "Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.\n": "You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!\n", "Good for you. That was really mature.\n": "What? No, the only reason  I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.\n", "All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.\n": "Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that \"thing\". What is it?\nI AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye! \n", "I was up all night writing this really nasty letter to Emily! It was perfect and now it's all covered in-in\u2026  Actually, thanks!\n": " All right! Everybody ready to go to the movies?\n", "Uh actually, I think I'm gonna skip it.\n": "Really?\n", "Yeah, I'm gonna stay and read my book. I just wanna be alone right now.\n": "Oh. Are you sure you don't want to come? Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, they get mail and stuff.\n", "That's okay, Joe.\n": "All right, let's go Pheebs.\n", "And a date with a man!\n": "Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey,  comes with a bag! \n", "Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.\n": "Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?\n", "Nngghhh!!!!!!!\n": " Can I use your phone?

Look, I live across the street,  and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay?  Yeah, I can see you right now!  Hello!  If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like\u2014\u2014Thank you, but... that's not really the point...  The point is that...  Mostly free weights, but occasionally..\n", "The green dress? Really?\n": "Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day.\n", "I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Y\u2019know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, so\u2026\n": "So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, that\u2019s nice!\n", "Yeah, right!\n": "I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of those\u2026\n", "So you might say, it\u2019s a magic ring.\n": " Yeah, the stripper stole it.\n", " All right-all right, fine! I-I\u2019m gonna call the cops!\n": "Dude, I screwed up, you don\u2019t have to turn me in!\n", "Not on you! On the stripper!\n": "Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said they\u2019re gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.\n", "Okay, well, we\u2019ll call the company that sent her!\n": "I did that too! They wouldn\u2019t give me her real name or her number. They said, \"If I bothered them again they\u2019d call the police.\" I said, \"If you talk to the police, you tell them I\u2019m missing a ring!\"\n", "So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there\u2019s nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!\n": "Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I\u2026\n", "What did I marry into?\n": "Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?\n", "Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.\n": "Seriously?\n", "They go into the hallway and see Mr. Treeger watching one of New York\u2019s bravest breakdown Monica and Chandler\u2019s door with an ax.]\n": "Whoa!

Besides, you\u2019re probably gonna be out by four anyway. We\u2019ve just got one short scene. It\u2019s just you and Richard, and God knows he\u2019s a pro. You\u2019ll be fine.  Morning Richard.\n": "Hey! You\u2019re here! Great! Great! Great! Let\u2019s get going buddy, we\u2019ve got a scene to shoot!\n", "I\u2019m wearing two belts.\n": "Are you drunk?\n", " Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up.

Roomie!\n", "Huh, yeah I guess we are roommates now.\n": "Yeah! Well, now that you brought it up, our fridge is broken. We have to get a new one. Now, I checked around and your half is $400. Thanks a lot.\n", "I\u2019m not paying for half of that! I\u2019m only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.\n": "Look Rach, my parents bought this fridge just after I was born, okay? Now, I have never had a problem with it. Then you show up and it breaks! What does that tell ya\u2019?\n", "That refrigerators don\u2019t live as long as people.\n": "All right, now you know that the ATM will only lets you take out 300 at a time, I\u2019ll take a check for the other hundred.\n", "You\u2019re jokin\u2019 right?\n": "Of course I\u2019m jokin\u2019! I don\u2019t take checks.\n", "Well, I thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that I don't want to move to the new house with me! So, enjoy: smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust, kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.\n": " Hey.\n", "Hey, where's Rach?\n": "Oh, she's putting Emma down, she'll be over in a second.\n", "Great.\n": "Now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off, ok?\n", "Hi you guys!\n": "What did I just say?\n", "Yes, Joe?\n": "I forgot to pick up my dry cleaning!\n", "Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?\n": "Huh, if I had to  guess I'd say Rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and Phoebe is doing the punching.\n", "That might work! \n": "Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah!  Enh? All right, what do you think?\n", " No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden.  No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye. \n": "What's the matter Ross?\n", "Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.\n": "That's way uptown! That's like three trains away!  Which is great! I love to ride that rail!\n", "Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.\n": "Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him?  Ow!! He's not even here!!!\n", " Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!\n": "Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?\n", "Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?\n": "Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella. \n", " Well we left ours in Monica\u2019s bedroom.\n": "Nope, got it and I got yours  too. \n", "What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?\n": "I couldn't do it.\n", "Good for you, Joey.\n": "When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.\n", "I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t come!\n": "So what if he didn\u2019t come! We can still go out and party ourselves!\n", "Yeah! We\u2019d meet, we\u2019d meet total strangers, and hang out with them!\n": "Well, we could do that! \n", "There\u2019s other stuff too.\n": "We\u2019ll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!\n", "Yeah!!\n": "Yeah!! \n", "It\u2019s not like we don\u2019t know how to party!!\n": "Yeah! All right? Let\u2019s go!\n", "Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?\n": "What, are you crazy? You haven\u2019t beaten me once since my injury plagued \u201997 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.\n", "Yes it would. What do you say to $50?\n": "Okay, you\u2019re on.\n", "Ehh, you're just liquored up.\n": "Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!\n", "For the last time no! Get out! Get out, Joey!\n": "All right!\n", "He painted that. \n": "Wow! That\u2019s pretty nice. I thought he cut off his ear \u2018cause he sucked. What else you got in there?\n", "Let\u2019s see, ahhh\u2026 Where does the Pope live?\n": "In the woods. No wait-wait, that\u2019s the joke answer.\n", "Actually its, Vatican City. Now ahh, what do you know about vulcanised rubber?\n": "Spock\u2019s birth control.\n", "Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts  musings, if you will!\n": "What... for how long?\n", "Only like a month!\n": " A MONTH??\n", "What the... DIAL IT DOWN!  Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us!  Ok, dial it up a little!\n": " I just have one question!\n", "Shoot!\n": " What the hell are you doin'???\n", "I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious...  what that would be like?...\n": "Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!\n", " Who...?\n": "CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!\n", "Oh yes, of course, I remember him!\n": "Yeah, he had a paper route.\n", "Yeah, he did!  Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!\n": "No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!\n", "But can it... just... happen a little bit?\n": " NO, NO! It can't happen at all!\n", "But why, why not?\n": "Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok?  I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no!  I couldn't do it to Ross!\n", "But that wasn't gonna stop you before!\n": "I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right...  I'm sorry...!\n", " I'm sorry, too!  OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!\n": "NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!\n", "It's not a big deal!\n": "NO BIG DEAL!\n", "It's so not a big deal!\n": "Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!\n", "Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related   emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.\n": "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better   if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if   he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. \n", "Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.\n": "Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how   about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.\n", "Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again   we can't...\n": "I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can   control ourselves, we're not animals.\n", "No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that   means good night then?\n": "Yeah! Good night! \n", "Goo--ood night!\n": "Good night! \n", "Seriously, good night!\n": "Stop saying good night.\n", "This pregnancy is throwing me all off.\n": "All right, I\u2019m gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.\n", "Oh, me too!\n": "Why would you need to say hi to them, you\u2019ve been feeding them for four days?\n", "Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?\n": "Check it out!! Jam crackers!\n", "Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy.  Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'\n": "Yeah, the Knicks rule!\n", "Joey, this is you!\n": "Let me see.  Oh, right.\n", "When did you go to a sperm bank?\n": "Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?\n", "And that's how you bought it?\n": "Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.\n", "Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.\n": "Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.\n", "Thank you, Monica.\n": "Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.\n", "Well, here\u2019s a schedule of what\u2019s coming up. \n": "Thanks.  Well but this one starts now. \n", "Oh that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible. It\u2019s a twins study. \n": "But it\u2019s $2,000.\n", "I do NOT want this unit!!\n": "Well, you should\u2019ve told me that before, I\u2019m not a mind reader. Hey, we\u2019re out of beer. I\u2019m going to Monica\u2019s.\n", "Will it? Will it?! I mean, how would you feel if you found out you were 31?\n": "That\u2019s not gonna happen. No.  Because we have a new deal!\n", "Plus, it totally ruined my schedule! I\u2026I haven\u2019t done any of the things I wanted to do by the time I was 31!\n": "Like what?\n", "Hey.  Oh, poor Pheebs.\n": "Hey, y\u2019know what you guys? I think I\u2019m gonna go walk her home.  \n", "He\u2019s gonna eat the cake!\n": "Pheebs! Wait up!  Listen uh, close your eyes.  Maybe that\u2019s one thing you can cross off your list.\n", "Oh yeah.\n": "Oh, and plus I\u2019m 1/16th Portuguese.\n", "Well, you\u2026don\u2019t look good Joe.\n": "The fridge broke. I have to eat everything. Cold cuts, ice cream, limes\u2014Hey, what was in that brown jar?\n", "That\u2019s still in there?!\n": "Not anymore. So anyway, how do you want to pay me?\n", "Is this a service you\u2019re providing me?\n": "No! No! No! For my new fridge\u2014our new fridge!\n", "Our new fridge? I don\u2019t live here anymore.\n": "So what? Look, suppose we were a divorced couple.\n", "Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight. \n": "All right! Who is he?\n", "Oh, yeah.\n": "She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher! \n", "A teacher?\n": "Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh,       oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?\n", "Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey,       you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman! \n": "Oh my god, you're right! \n", "How do you even know a woman like that?\n": "What? I'm not allowed to know smart women? \n", "So now what do we do?\n": "Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled,       and find him somebody else.\n", "What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the       date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets       stood up!\n": "Ooh...I hear that's bad. \n", "Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross       gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.\n": "Ah, yes, The Plan! \n", "It's not Santa's plan. No, it's... \n": "Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.\n", "All right, I\u2019ll see you downstairs then.\n": "All right.\n", "No, no, no.

How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?\n", "Forget about her.\n": "He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.\n", "Yeah... I guess. I don't\u2014I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? \n": "Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.\n", "Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'\n": "Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.\n", "Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?\n": "Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...\nThen you do.

I've to get surgery on my knee, you just lost me ten grand!\n": "Oh, wow! I'm so sorry, ok? I promise, we'll do better next time!\n", "Well, I will, because I won't be playing with you.\n": "Hey, you know, some of those are pretty hard! Like why would there be a ghost in my fridge? . Yeah!\n", "Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?\n": "Uh-huh.\n", "How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?\n": "It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.\n", "Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's       just stupid.\n": "We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really       bonding.\n", "Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.\nOh, they see us!

I just told him, very nicely, \"You don\u2019t go buying people\u2019s babies, so back off!!\"\n", "No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn\u2019t want to buy my baby! I made that up!\n": "What?! Why?!\n", "So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn\u2019t be awkward!\n": "And you couldn\u2019t think of anything else?!\n", "Oh Joey, I can\u2019t believe you brought my boss into this! I\u2019m gonna get fired!\n": "You lied to me!\n", "All right!! Fine! Fine.\n": "Arrrghh!!\n", "Oh, this is horrible, it\u2019s just horrible.\n": "Guys, do you think we should ask Ross to come along?\n", "Here we go again.\n": "I-I can\u2019t handle this, you guys.\n", "Really Joey?\n": " What?\n", "Obviously not to Joey.\n": " What?\n", "Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! Hey!!!  Look what you\u2019re doing to Chandler!!   Yeah, look, we know this is really, really hard for you guys. Okay?  You don\u2019t, all right you don\u2019t have to love each other, okay? You don\u2019t, you don\u2019t even have to like each other much right now. But please, you have to figure out a way to be around each other.\n": "Yeah, and not put us in the middle.\n", "Okay. Good, all right, let\u2019s get back in the car, \u2018cause it\u2019s freezing, and my chest is unsupported.\n": "Oh what, wait, wait a second, I mean, what are we doing? Who\u2019s going with who?\n", "Look, you guys, you guys should go.  No, I\u2019m, you, you planned this all out, and I don\u2019t want to ruin it, so you guys should just go.\n": "Come on man, you drove all the way up here.\n", "And the world will never know.\n": "Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?\n", "Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.\n": "No-no! No! No! You don\u2019t tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I\u2019m a soap actor.\n", "But you\u2019re not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.\n": "Hey!\n", "I like your bow.\n": " I\u2019d like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like,  \"Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!\" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories.  And-and there was some sad memories.  I\u2019m sorry. And-and some scared memories\u2014Whoa!  Eh? And then, and then I realized I\u2019ll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity.  Oh! To the happy couple!\n", "Maybe I should stand on your feet! \n": "So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?\n", "Oh my God, that was for my benefit?\n": "Well, I\u2019d like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you\u2019re casting for this new show\u2026\n", "Look umm Joey, I-I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite right for this project.\n": "Oh, see that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn\u2019t see it up there, just-just try me.\n", "It\u2019s an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?\n": "Well I\u2019m not proud of this, but\u2026 \n", " You\u2019re absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don\u2019t know exactly when it\u2019s going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that\u2019s it.\n": "I\u2019m so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.\n", "Yeah, thanks.\n": "No I mean it! I can\u2019t believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!\n", "Oh you\u2019re right. Thank you! What\u2019s your name again?\n": "Joey.\n", " I\u2019m having a conversation here!  You were saying?\n": "Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye\u2014l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I\u2019m really nervous about-about being you. Y\u2019know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y\u2019know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?\n", "All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.\n": "Oh that\u2019s great! Oh thank you so much!\n", "You\u2019re so welcome.\n": "Hey! Now, I\u2019ve been watching some tapes, how\u2019s this?  \"Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!\"\n", "Is that supposed to be me?\n": "Yeah.\n", "I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.\n": "But hey, Ross, this place is available now!\n", "Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.\n": "Yeah.\n", " So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?\n": "Oh, it's perfect!\n", "Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute! \n": " And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...\n", "Hi, oh, I\u2019m Lauren, Kate\u2019s understudy.\n": "Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.\n", "I know!

Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?\n": "Well Ahh,  yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.\n", "Cool! I-I\u2019ll see you then.\n": "All right.\n", "Joey, just ignore the boats all right? We\u2019re not finished with the lesson yet.\n": "All right.\n", "Okay, I\u2019m just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?\n": "Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Let\u2019s start sailing, and I want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is!  Yo-ho-ho!\n", "Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, let\u2019s do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though,  what\u2019s this called?\n": "Uh, boat rope.\n", "Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?\n": "Uhh, rub it?\n", "No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?\n": "I\u2019d say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uh\u2026\n", "Time\u2019s up, now your dead.\n": "And deaf!\n", "Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! \n": "Yes.\n", "You guys make a very attractive couple. \n": "Yeah, we look great together.\n", "Wow! Imagine what our kids would look like!\n": "Y\u2019know, we don\u2019t have to imagine.\n", "I\u2019m marrying her.\n": "We\u2019ll just see.\n", "Umm, I\u2019m gonna just go get this warmed up. \n": "Okay.\n", "Mento?\n": "No thanks.\n", "No, no, with him.  I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.\n": "Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.\n", "What are you crazy? That's a baby!\n": "He should take the sack?\n", "Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.\n": "Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.\nOh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?\n", "Well, only if you order stuff.\n": "I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.\n", "Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?\n": "When's that?\n", "Tonight.\n": "Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?\n", "There it is! So what're you gonna do?\n": "What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.\n", "And your friend Phoebe?\n": "Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?\n", "Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even    want it in my home...  Joey, don't touch it!!\n": "I'm so confused!\n", "Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! \n": "Got it!  Hey hey hey!

You never said anything about an audition!\n", " Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition.    I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to    have a monologue prepared.\n": "A monologue? I don't have..  I got it.      Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!\n", "No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.\n": "Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright?

How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?\n", "Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother\u2019s not going to punch me.  Are ya?\n": "Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you\u2019d be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!\n", "Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!\n": "No! No! No! No, I\u2019m not going to punch Chandler.\n", "I\u2019ll do it.\n": "No you won\u2019t. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he\u2019s sorry. But,  you\u2019ve got one more apology to make, all right, you\u2019ve got to apologize to Mary-Angela.\n", "Okay, absolutely!\n": "All right.\n", "You\u2019ve got it. \n": "Cookie, now you can punch him!\n", "What are you guys doing here?\n": "Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married!

Okay, he\u2019s very special to me.\n": "Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!\n", "She was?\n": "Well, she graduated from high school!\n", "Okay, whatever. Y\u2019know what? I don\u2019t have time have time to convince you because he\u2019s only here for four hours, and I\u2019m gonna go see him! \n": "Fine!\n", "What else is new?\n": "Yeah and we\u2019d go check it out, but you took away our keys.\n", "Well do something! Get in there!\n": "How? I guess I could break down your door.\n", "Yeah! Do that!\n": "And-and you won\u2019t blame us for any damage? \n", "No!  Are you doing it?! I don\u2019t hear anything! Come on!\n": "Uh, okay I\u2019ll-I\u2019ll-I\u2019ll break it down. \n", "Last night!

Argh!!!\n", "Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?\n": "Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.\n", "Who are you kidding?  You just find some   guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!\n": "Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like   this guy I can find you a better one.  Mike!!

Y\u2019know I would\u2019ve been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y\u2019know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day! \n", "Wait Joey! You didn\u2019t need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.\n": "And scene! Huh? Wasn\u2019t that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?\n", "Well, the director thinks you\u2019re really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.\n": "Wow! Sure! That\u2019s great!\n", "Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.\n": "Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it\u2019s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.\n", "Terrific! Well uh, there\u2019s one more thing. Uhh, uh it\u2019s really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she\u2019s never seen a naked man who wasn\u2019t Jewish. So\u2026 \n": "So\u2026What?\n", "So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I\u2019m saying?\n": "Yes!\n", "Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.\n": "Right.\u00a0 Thanks.\u00a0 It's June.\u00a0 I'm outta here. \n", "I say \u2018cheesy line\u2019, but ok.\n": "What\u2019s the matter?\n", "Ok, so sorry.\nI am sorry!

He doesn\u2019t make any noise!\n", "Well, he gets the other one all riled up.\n": "Look, we are not gonna\u2026\n", " All right, hold on! If you win, we give up the birds.\n": " Dah!! \n", "I didn't know there were docks.\n": "Hey.\n", "Aww, is it broken?\n": "No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. \n", "Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?\n": "Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.\n", "Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket.\n": "What is this? Fruit?\n", "Monica's making jam.\n": "Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?\n", "cars. \n": "Hey!\n", "Relax!

How come we didn\u2019t cross paths?\n": "Yeah well that\u2019s because uh\u2026I stayed in my room. Yeah, you\n", "Your favorite!\n": "Ho-ho-ho,  fried stuff with cheese!\n", "You crossed the line. Joey, describe for Gene these things that have lines. Give me 20 seconds on the clock, please. Ready, go!\n": " Uhm... ok. It's a store, like a supermarket.  Oh! I see-I see what I did. Yeah, ok, ok, uhm... I'm writing in my...\n", "Diary.\n": "Noo,  more like a notebook... Damn it!  Oh, if I'm building an house, the plan isn't called the 'shmoo-print'... Can't say that either?

I didn\u2019t get the part, and I lost my job here, so \u2026\n", "How-how did you lose your job here?\n": "Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.\n", "He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you\u2019ve been working here two days? That\u2019s not, that\u2019s not right.\n": "Yeah, what are ya gonna do?\n", "That\u2019s right, he can have his job back. I\u2019m glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.\n": "That\u2019s great. Thanks Rach.\n", "Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.\n": " You talked to him. Are you crazy?\n", "No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.\n": " Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean  \n", "Joey, this is for you.  It's blackberry curin.\n": "Aww.  Ohh!\n", "Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam. \n": "Put your hands together.\n", "Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.\n": "No more jam?!\n", "Oh hey you guys, I couldn\ufffdt get a reservation for the night of  my birthday, so we have to do dinner Thursday night instead.\n": "Thursday? But that\ufffds Halloween.\n", "So?\n": "So...I've never played that!\n", "Everything? Even the TV?\n": "No! I\u2019m putting that in my room.\n", "Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don\u2019t you think you could at least hear the guy out?\n": "Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?\n", "That\u2019s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?\n": "Five years. \n", "You\u2019ve sentenced him?!\n": "Hey! Don\u2019t do the crime if you can\u2019t do the time.\n", "Joey, the guy\u2019s your best friend.\n": "No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there\u2019s a spot open.\n", "Oh, who? Me?\n": "Yeah!\n", "Wow! I\u2019m honored! And y\u2019know what I\u2019m gonna do as my first act as your best friend?\n": "What?\n", "Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge.

Settle down.\n": "All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor\u2026\n", "Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.\n": "It's almost as if he knew.\n", "Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?\n": "Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!\n", "How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!\n": "You can totally tell! Here look, watch me.  Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown.  Smile! \n", "Why, what happened?\n": "What happened? What happened?\n", "What? What? What? What is it?\n": "Is everything okay?\n", "Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.\nHey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire.  Hey, look at that!

Charity?\n", " Mr. Tribbiani.\n": "Oh hi!\n", "Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.\n": "Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?\n", "I think it was valued at 19,000\n": " Hey, I was pretty close.  Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can\u2019t buy the boat, I don\u2019t have any money.\n", "That\u2019s good. Very good! \n": "So uh listen, I think I\u2019m gonna take off now. \n", " Hey! You\u2026can\u2019t\u2026leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!\n": "Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don\u2019t have that kind of money!\n", "I know. Okay.  Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we\u2019re gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you\u2019re just gonna pay the difference.\n": "Okay.\n", "Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?\n": "Ooh... Not so good.\n", "Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?\n": "Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.\n JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!\n", "Oh God. What about you, Joe? What would you give up, sex or food?\n": "Uhm... oh...

Yeah, what the hell is that? What smells so bad?\n", "You.\n": "Y\u2019know, I can see why you think that, but ah, actually, you know who I think it is?\n", "You?\n": "No-no, it\u2019s uh, it\u2019s Heston.\n", "There\u2019s no way he smells, he\u2019s the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room.\n": "Really, a shower huh? And uh, which-which room might that be?\n", "Do you still work here?\n": "No! No, I quit a long time ago.  Did I forget to you that one?

You know, this isn't fair.    What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off?    Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her,    and might want something real?  Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this    way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.\n", "Come on! Joe!\n": "Ok \n", "Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!\n": "Sorry. Wrong boobies.\n", "Oh! ...Hello, dear. \n": "I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.\n", "She lent me an egg once.\n": "You're in!\n", "Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian\u2014I don't think we need a third... \n": "Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.\n", "An egg?\n": "Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, \"Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.\"\n", "She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.\n": "Think it'll work?\n", "Is that a real thing?\n": "Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.\n", "Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.\n": "What\u2019s up?\n", "It\u2019s-it\u2019s about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.\n": "You do?\n", "Oh uh, when?\n": "Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, that\u2019s why I let people watch.\n", "Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?\n": "Well, I\u2019ve been better. But, I\u2019m all right. So you like her huh?\n", "Yes, but I-I uh, don\u2019t have too.\n": "No-no-no, no it\u2019s uh, it\u2019s okay.\n", "Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.\n": "But hey, listen just so you know, you might have you\u2019re work cut out for you. \u2018Cause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that she\u2019s into some other guy. So\u2026\n", "See uh, that\u2019s-that\u2019s actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.\n": "Who?\n", "It\u2019s me. I\u2019m the other guy.\n": "What?\n", "Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another and\u2026\n": "And what?! Did you sleep with her?!\n", "No! No! No! I just kissed her.\n": "What?!! That\u2019s even worse!!\n", "How is that worse?!\n": "I don\u2019t know! But it\u2019s the same!\n", "Look, I\u2019m sorry! But there\u2019s nothing I can do, I think I\u2019m in love with her!\n": "Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!\n", "You\u2019re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.\n": "Over the line?! You-you\u2019re-you\u2019re so far past the line, that you-you can\u2019t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!\n", "Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!\n": "Is that why you bought all this stuff?!  Well, y\u2019know what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and there\u2019s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that I\u2019m not gonna eat! You know why?!\n", "Really.\n": "Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.\n", "You still can't stand her can you?\n": "I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.\n", "Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.\n": "But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.\n", "Well, I guess that's something.\n": "No man, that's huge!

Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.\n": "Thank you! \n", "Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck? \n": "Oh, ah- the kid has it. \n", "Hi, I'm Sandy.\n": "Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.\n", "Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.\n": "Wow, that's, uh, dirty.\n", "Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!\n": " Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?\n", " Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...\n": "There y'go, kids.\n", " And then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight. \n": "You seen Sandy?\n", "And the moment of joy is upon us.\n": "Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.\n", "So I'm kissing everyone?\n": "Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.\n", "Next. \n": "Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.\n", "Name?\n": "Holden McGroin.\n", "We\u2019re never gonna find anybody.\n": "Well then let me do it!\n", "Joe\u2026\n": "No-no-no! Look, I\u2019ve been thinking about it. I\u2019m an actor right? So I won\u2019t get nervous talking in front of people.\n", "Joey look it\u2019s really sweet\u2026\n": "No-no-no-no look no! I won\u2019t spit, and I won\u2019t stare at Monica\u2019s breasts! Y\u2019know? Everyone knows I\u2019m an ass man!\n", "That is true.\n": "Yeah and the most important thing is that it won\u2019t be some like, stranger up there who barely knows you. It\u2019ll be me! And I swear I\u2019ll do a really good job. Plus, y\u2019know I love you guys and-and it would really mean a lot to me.\n", "It might be kinda cool.\n": "So I can do it?\n", "Yeah you can do it.\n": "All right!!! Okay!! All right! Okay-okay, I gotta get started on my speech! Oh, wait a minute, Internet ministers can still have sex right?\n", "Yes! Please!\n": "You're not gonna like it.\n", "That's okay.\n": "You got married to fast.\n", "That's not advice!\n": "I told ya.\n", "I'm going to the bathroom. \n": "Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.\n", "Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?\n": "I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there. \n", "Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.\n": "Hey, you're not Kip!\n", " Do you even know who Kip is?\n": "Who cares? You're Rachel!  Who's Kip?\n", "Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.\n": "Oh, that poor bastard.\n", " Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had- \n": "-Peaches? \n", "Because it\u2019s the highest.  Okay, Rachel you\u2019re up first.  Situation No. 1: You\u2019re with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! \n": " I don\u2019t want to marry Chandler!\n", "Okay, uh\u2026\n": "I\u2019ve got cold feet.\n", "\u2026it\u2019s gonna be okay!\n": "No, one man for the rest of my life? I don\u2019t know if I can do it! This means I\u2019ll never get to sleep with Joey!\n", "Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Y\u2019know, it\u2019s-it\u2019s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You don\u2019t get to keep the gifts.\n": " Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!\n", "Yes! Your honor?\n": "We\u2019re now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, \"I do\" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!\n", "Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, I\u2019ve known them separately and I\u2019ve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass  to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.\n": "Wow.  Good speech.\n", "Okay Phoebe, I guess you\u2019re next  although I really don\u2019t see the point.\n": "Yeah.\n", "Okay.  I am so hot!\n": " Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.\n", "I cannot believe we're having this conversation.\n": "C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.\n", "Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? \n": " Mother-Kisser...  I'll shut up.\n", "My\u2014Oh my God!\n": "I know! They suck!!\n", "He\u2019s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I\u2019m supposed to do that!\n": "I know!\n", "Well what\u2026 Y\u2019know what I\u2019m gonna do? I\u2019m gonna go over there; I\u2019m gonna kick his ass!  Will you help me?!\n": "Look, Chandler I don\u2019t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!\n", "You\u2019re right.\n": "Yeah!\n", "Okay.  I\u2019m gonna get the ring! I\u2019m gonna get the ring!  I\u2019m gonna go find her and  I\u2019m just going to propose!\n": "Okay.\n", "Okay great.\n": "Dude-dude-dude!\n", "Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.\n": "Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!\n", "What\u2019s taking you boys so long?\n": "In a minute!\n", " In a minute? What\u2019s gonna happen in a minute?!\n": "All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.\n", "Why me?!\n": "Hey! It\u2019s your bachelor party.\n", "Which is why you should do it.\n": "I don\u2019t want to. You do it!\n", "You do it!\n": "You do it!\n", "All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave!  What?\n": "I miss this.\n", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve actually done this before!\n": "No, I-I miss hanging out with you.\n", "Well we\u2026we still hang out.\n": "Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y\u2019know now it\u2019s like\u2026things are different.\n", "Well y\u2019know, things are different. I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m married now.\n": "Oh sure\u2014And hey, don\u2019t get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just\u2026I miss\u2026hanging out\u2026just-just us, y\u2019know?\n", "Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we\u2019ll make time to hang out with each other.\n": "You got it. Come here. \n", "It\u2019s a little early to be drinkin\u2019.\n": "No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.\n", "You\u2019re kidding?! That\u2019s great!\n": "Oh, it was so amazing. After the  love making...\n", "Oh my.\n": "Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming \u2018cause, \u2018cause her eyes keep going like this. \n", "But you are?\n": "Yep.\n", "But you told them you weren\u2019t?\n": "That\u2019s right.\n", "Wow! Wow! And it\u2019s definitely all gone? There\u2019s nothing there to work with?  What were you thinking?\n": "I don\u2019t know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell \u2018em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.\n", "Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to\u2026grow a turtleneck!\n": "I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.\n", "Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!\n": "I just have to call my agent and tell her I can\u2019t do the part. \n", "Unless!\n": "Unless what?\n", "Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.\n": "Like what?\n", "He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.\n": "We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...\n", "Joey!! \n": "Yeah?\n", "Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!\n": "Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!\n", "They love my candy? Oh man!!! I\u2019ve gotta go make more!! \n": "Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might\u2019ve happened to a huge chunk of it.\n", "Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.\n": " We can't do that.\n", " What? What can't you do?\n": "Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?\nUh, we might be leaving now.\n", "Tell me it's \"you and me\" we.\n": "She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.\n", "Ok, you can not do this to me.\n": "You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.\n", " Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?\n": "I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.\n", "Oak, maple, elm, birch...\n": "I-I-I don't know. Types of trees?\n", "Uhm... Buenos d\u00edas, enchilada, por favor...\n": " Oh, I'm so sorry.

Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn\u2019t have the car! Right?\n", "Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.\n": "Oh, I\u2019ve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. \n", "Joey, you know you don\u2019t actually have one.\n": "Come on! What are you doing?! I\u2019m in character! Would you talk to her! \n", "Uhhh, yeah. But it's not obvious why.\n": "Well look, I\u2019m breaking up with Katie so I had to put on some extra padding. Y'know? I mean, if she hits me when she's happy, can you imagine how hard she's gonna hit me when I tell her I'm taking away the Joey love?\n", "Oww!!!! Joey, she just kicked me.\n": "Huh.\n", "Well? Aren't you gonna do something?\n": "Uhh\u2026.\n", "What, you don\u2019t think I know that?\n": "Look, the point is, there\u2019s a lot of women out there you haven\u2019t even had sex with yet!\n", "Okay, but isn\u2019t sex better when it\u2019s with one person that you really, really care about.\n": "Yeah, in a poem maybe.\n", "Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I\u2019ve got with Alice.\n": "Now, wh-what, what is that like?\n", "Yeah, yeah.\n": " Why can\u2019t I find that?\n", "Don\u2019t ask me, I had it and I blew it!\n": "Well, I want it!\n", "You can have it!\n": "I don\u2019t know, maybe I can\u2019t. I mean, maybe there\u2019s something wrong with me.\n", "It\u2019s out there man! I\u2019ve seen it! I got it!!\n": "Then you hold on to it!!\n", "They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.\n": "Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma!  Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?\n", "Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!\n": "I was?\n", "Yes and you talked to her...\n": "I did?\n", "She dropped off a casserole?\n": "Oh yeah! The casserole lady.\n", "Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.\n": "Ooh! Tough odds!\n", "Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!\n": "Look who's coming around!\n", "Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.\n": "Did you get it?\n", "One of the slots got filled.\n": "By you!?\n", "Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.\n": "I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.\n", "Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?\n": "I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!\n", "Right! .. but we \"know\" what you're wishing for!\n": "Can't really say!\n", "I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?\n": "I'm not really comfortable with these questions!\n", "One, two, three!\n": "I won, hey!\n", "Ooh! Calm down ...\n": "Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it? \n", "Oh, I'm sorry, did I say \"invest it\"? I meant \"be cool and piss it all away\" \n": "Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!\n", "I don't really care about the Knicks.\n": "Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.\n", "You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.\n": "You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!\n", "Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! ..

Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !\n": "Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!\n", "No, no! We should divide them up  and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!\n": "Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea! \n", "Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up! \n": " Oh!\n", "Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.\n": "No, no! \n", "Hey, this isn\u2019t like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!\nY'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.\n": "Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.\n", "Great!

Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?\n": "Uh-huh.\n", "You guuuyys.\n": "And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.\n", "Hmm, mild discomfort. So I take it you\u2019ve had one of these Braxton thingies?\n": "So but everything is normal.\n", "Absolutely.\n": "And-and there\u2019s no danger to her and the baby?\n", "Thank you doctor.   Oh thank you for being so nice and calm.\n": "Calm?! I wasn\u2019t calm!

O-okay.\n": " \"When I think of the love that these two givers and receivers share, I can not help but envy the lifetime ahead of having and loving and giving and\u2026\" And then I can\u2019t think of a good word for right here. \n", "How about receiving?\n": "Yes!\n", "See Joe, not that that\u2019s not grrreat! But, one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us! Y\u2019know, it can be more personal. You can tell stories about us!\n": "Ooh, like the time you and I went to Atlantic City and I made you laugh so hard you threw up your whole steak?!

And well we drank too much\u2026\n": "Yeah baby!\n", "And I was a perfect gentleman and I walked her to her hotel room and said goodnight.\n": "Oh.\n", "But then later that night\u2026\n": "Yeah baby!\n", "Eh!\nJoey!

This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like \u201cOh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?\u201d\nSo why don\u2019t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?\n": "Oh I am!\n", "Okay, fine!\n": "Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?\n", "Hey, what are you doing? You gotta save room, you\u2019ve got almost an entire turkey to eat.\n": "Let me explain to you how the human body works.

What is the capital of Columbia?\n", "Bogota.\n": "It\u2019s Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.\n", "What does a Wicked Wango card do?\n": "I should know that. Let\u2019s see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.\n", "Higher or lower than what?\n": "This is embarrassing. \n", "So Joey, you okay?\n": "Yeah, I guess.

No I don\u2019t!\n", "Whoa! Are you okay?\n": "Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.\n", "It\u2019s the heat.  And-and the humidity.\n": "That\u2019s a uh, that\u2019s a tough combination.\n", "Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?\n": "Like you wouldn\u2019t believe.  Wow! This is a great place.\n", "Thank you. Just make yourself comfortable.\n": "Gotcha.\n", "This place is really my Grandmother\u2019s.  I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I\u2019m 87 year old woman, who\u2019s afraid of her VCR. So are you thirsty?\n": "Oh, you bet I am!\n", "All right, Janice, likes him.

What are we gonna do?\n", "Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he   knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant.  That's not nonchalant!\n": "No idea what it means.\n", "Yeah, sure... \n": "I don't believe this... Have you guys been...\n", "You would think!\nJoey!\n": "Is he gone?\n", " How are you doing this?\n": "Pssst...\n", "Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated   this could get? What about Ross?\n": "Well, he's with Charlie now.\n", "Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything   really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think   he deserves the same from you?\n": " You're a pain in   my ass, Geller!\n", "Get out!\nAre they right?\n": "Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off   until we talk to Ross.\n", "Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have   to do anything tonight.\n": "Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna...   I'm gonna take off...\n", " Although... \n": " I like although!\n", "I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like...   six years...\n": "Six years? Wow...

I can't seem to get Ross out   of my head...\n": "Well, maybe I can help. \n", "Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do   that again... \n": "Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...\n", " And tell him what?\n": "Have you heard about a little something called, Not Making Girls Cry.\n", " Yeah. Well maybe you have heard about the Rent Stabilization Act of 1968!\n": "I have actually not heard of that.\n", "Yeah, it\u2019s great.\n": "Whoa-whoa, what\u2019s the matter?! Talk to the captain!\n", "I\u2019m just having one of those days where you realize you\u2019re in a dead-end relationship!\n": "Chandler giving you a hard time huh?\n", "It\u2019s not like I want to get married tomorrow! It\u2019s just that I-I\u2019d like to believe that I\u2019m in a relationship that\u2019s actually going somewhere, that I\u2019m not just wasting my time!\n": "Well, you know Chandler.\n", "No I don\u2019t know Chandler! Not anymore! It\u2019s like it\u2019s like something\u2019s changed.\n": "Maybe you changed?\n", "I didn\u2019t change!\n": "Maybe that\u2019s the problem.\n", "Is that some kind of boat talk?\n": "I don\u2019t know!  I haven\u2019t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.\n", "What does he think? Does he think I\u2019m just gonna wait around for nothing?\n": "Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!\n", " Well there\u2019s some people who do want to marry me.\n": "There are?\n", "Yeah! Richard!\n": "R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?!  And-and Chandler\u2019s tellin\u2019 ya how much he hates marriage?!\n", "That\u2019s right.\n": "You spent a hundred dollars. That\u2019s the limit. You\u2019re screwed!\n", "So the wedding caterer sent me this list of twelve appetizers and I have to narrow it down to six.\n": "Food? Uh-huh gimme! \n", "Staying out of the way.\n": "This is impossible Monica, why don\u2019t you just pick all 15? \n", "There were only twelve.\n": "Oh yeah, I added three.\n", "What are peanut butter fingers?!\n": "Oh yeah\u2026 \n", "Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.\n": "So what's it gonna be? \n", "I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!\n": "Or an uncle... \n", "Oh, right, that's me!\n": "Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.\n", "Well, he made a move on me.\n": "Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!\n", "This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don\u2019t work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.\n": " I bet I stopped listening before you did.\n", "I can\u2019t believe it.  Can I tell you something? I\u2019m a little mad at him now.\n": "Can I tell you something? Me too.\n", "Y\u2019know what? He didn\u2019t want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don\u2019t talk to him at all!\n": "Ooooh! Freeze him out.\n", "That\u2019s right!\n": "I like it!\n", "Monday?!\n": "How long do you have to go for?\n", "They said it could be up to a year.\n": "A year?!\n", "There is nothing like the support of your loving   wife, huh?\n": "Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot,   but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.\n", "I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be   able to make it.\n": "We were gonna go see the Jets!\n", "Not you.\n": "I can't believe you guys are moving.\n", "But ehm...what is it not?\n": " A place to entertain my lady friends.\n", "And what else is it not?\n": " A place to eat spaghetti.\n", "Very good!  What do you need it for anyway?\n": "Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...\n", "Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?\n": "Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.\n", "Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself! \n": "Uh!\n", "The woman just vanished!\n": "Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?\n", "Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.\n": "I like those odds!\n", "Kinda like Joey.\n": "What's that now?\n", "What\u2019s going on over here?\n": "Uh, take a look at the guy\u2019s pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but don\u2019t you think he went a little overboard?\n", "What\u2019s the matter with you? Get out of here!\n": "Yeah, take a hike wetpants!\n", "Cut!\n": "That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?\n", " I know!!!\n": " Hey!\n", "Oh nothing, we\u2019re just talking. Y\u2019know, blah-blah-blah.\n": "Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.\n", "Well, I\u2019d like to but,  I\u2019m not sure we have time to go.\n": "Ha-ha, very funny\u2014Look! I don\u2019t know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!\n", "We owe you?!\n": "That\u2019s right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!\n", "No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed   to be this... difficult?\n": "I don't know.\n", "No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...\n": "Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it   was... really wrong?\n", "Well, just because it happened that way for them   doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.\n": "Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's   difficult doesn't mean that you quit.\n", "Right, totally.\n": "Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we...   do it.\n", "Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one   of those couples that never have sex.\n": "That's a... pla-an.\n Wow... I did not see this coming.\n", "I know.  Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what   I wanted. \nHmmm... Me too...\nI wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?\n": "I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.\n", "Aah... I bet you're right.\n": "So...\n", "Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.\n": "Yeah, me too.\nOoh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.\n", "That\u2019s what you say about porn.\n": "You\u2019re right. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t even go on the call back.\n", "No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!\n": "Well that\u2019s true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character\u2019s catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It\u2019s really sweet and-and tender.\n", "You know, it's...  something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. \n": " I gotta get one, too.\n", "Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.\n": "Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.\n", "It did at first, but not anymore.\n": "Chandler?\n", "As much as he needs.\n": "Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?\n", "(quietly) Yay!\n": "So, so is she still going to Paris?\n", "Y\u2019know who doesn\u2019t even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.\n": "Yeah right.\n", "Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?\n": "Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!\n", "What do I do now?\n": "You play hard to get.\n", "She already lives in London.\n": "Then you go to Tokyo.\n", " Okay, here we go...\n": "Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!\n", "Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.\n": "Uh, four.\n", "Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.\n": "Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?\n", "Or you can do volunteer work.\n": "Hello?\n", "Joey! It\u2019s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.\n": "One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!\n", "Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You\u2019ll be sitting next to HotGuy372.\n": "Oh my God. So that\u2019s it?! I only get to bring one guest?\n", "Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up?  Hello?\n": " Did you hear that? I only get one extra ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.\n", " What-what about me?\n": "You said you didn\u2019t want to go.\n", "I don\u2019t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just because I\u2019m pregnant you think I\u2019m invisible.\n": "Definitely not invisible.\n", "Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart. What does it tell you?  Phoebe, Phoebe.\n": "Well uh\u2026I think I want to take Chandler.\n", "You really want to take me?\n": "Yeah! Yeah! I mean I\u2019m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but y\u2019know Chandler always supported my career. He\u2019s paid for acting classes and head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.\n", "Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you\u2019re gonna take him? Joey, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re comprehending just how slutty this dress is!\n": "It\u2019s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it\u2019s-it\u2019s everything. Y\u2019know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn\u2019t get parts that I really wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn\u2019t believe in myself.\n", "I always knew you were gonna make it. I\u2019m so proud of you.\n": "Thanks. That means a lot to me.\n", "Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.\n": " I\u2019m gonna go shave. \n", "Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.\n": "Yeah, hero sandwiches. \n", "Oh yes!\n": "Okay, get ready to owe me!\n", " Hombre? \n": "What's he doin' in my section?\n", "I guess he doesn't know.\n": "Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok?  Hey, how ya doin'?\n", "Mornin'. \n": "Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.\n", "Your territory, huh?\n": "Yeah. Bijan for men?\n", " Not two years in a row.\n": "Look, I\u2019ll come to the party but I\u2019m not dressing up.\n", "You have to!\n": "No way! Look, Halloween is so stupid! Dressing up, pretending to be someone you\u2019re not\u2026\n", "Yeah. Yeah, I think I will.\n": "That hot girl from their wedding?\n", "Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.\nEeeee--ohh!! God! \n": "Argh-argh!!  Ooh, soft. Is this mink?\n", "I'll take it all.\n": "Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?\n", "Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.\n": " What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?\n", "Now calm down Joey.\n": "No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!\n", " All right listen, I have to go to the bathroom, but if the place with the big fish comes up again. I\u2019d like know whether that\u2019s several big fish or just one big fish.\n": " So ah, Phoebe tells us you write jingles.\n", "Actually I said she abandoned me to write jingles.\n": " Ah, anything we might of heard of?\n", "Okay, ah, see ya Pheebs. \n": " Wow, that was kinda brutal.\n", "Oh, somebody will.\n": " You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?\n", "You're kidding.\n": "No, no. He said \"When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?\"\n", "Y'know, you'd think I would've.\n": "Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?\n", "Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.\n": "Chandler, will you just come in already?\n", "Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.\n": "Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.\n", "That's not a question.\n": "But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.\n", "The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.\n": "The balloon?\n", " Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.\n": "No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.\n", "What, now?\n": "Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!\n", " Look come on, eh, just ah, just ah, put your arms around me, eh.\n Ahhhh! I\u2019m sorry!\n": "No, it\u2019s okay, but if I\u2019m Marge, my breasts are coming out my back.\n", " Ahh, forget it! I\u2019ll never be any good at this, my mom was right, I\u2019m just a big potato with arms, and legs, and a head.\n": "Come on man, you\u2019re not a potato.\n", " I\u2019m sure as hell a dancer, it\u2019s no use Marge will never go for me.\n": "Come on Treeger, don\u2019t say that. You just ahh, you just need more practice. Here, come on, let\u2019s ahh, let\u2019s try it again. Come on.  Plus, it was, it was probably mostly my fault, anyway. I mean, y\u2019know, I\u2019m not really that comfortable dancing with a\u2014 We-he!! Hey!\n", "Well, I\u2019m not gonna talk because\u2026\n": " Damnit Carl! \n", "  Can I have the next one please?

Maybe we can send him some-some big-big flowers and scare him!\n": "How could you do this to me Chandler?! This part could\u2019ve turned my whole career around!\n", "I messed up. Okay? I\u2019m sorry, I really messed up.\n": "Hey, you don\u2019t even live here anymore! What are you doing answering my phone?

The line is a dot to you!\n", "Look, I\u2019m not saying that you should magically forgive me! But you\u2019re not perfect! You\u2019ve made some errors in judgment too!\n": "Name one!\n", " What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!\n": " Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn\u2019t think big enough to fit a grown man!\n", " So--You got in voluntarily?!\n": " I was tryin\u2019 to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I\u2019m gonna do?\n", "I talked to Janice.\n": "Oh my God, is she going back to him?\n", "She doesn\u2019t know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can\u2019t even return them, because she choked on the reciept!\n": "What are you ah, what are you gonna do?\n", "I don\u2019t know, y'know. What, what, would you do?\n": "Well, it doesn\u2019t matter what I would do.\n", "Come on, tell me.\n": "All right, you\u2019re probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me,  I would ah, I would bow out.\n", "There\u2019s this kid in my class who said he\u2019s in love with me.\n": "Whoa!\n", " Whoa what?\n": "Ross has a boyfriend.\n", "Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. \n": " I'll be right back.  What was that?\n", "Hey, look, what do you want from me?\n": "I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.\n", "I am pretending.\n": "Well then, do it better!\n", "Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones! \n": "Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?\n", "Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.\n": "Yeah?\n", "It\u2019s me. It\u2019s Phoebe. Listen there\u2019s something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?\n": "Is it the shampoo? It\u2019s guava.\n", "Yes. Yes. Yes. I can\u2019t believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can\u2019t eat meat!\n": "Oh, wait-wait!  Maybe it\u2019s a pickle?!\n", "Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!\n": "What\u2019s going on?\n", "It\u2019s Chandler\u2019s way of pretending he didn\u2019t take mime.\n": "Oh well listen, anyway she\u2019s directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!\n", "Oh, I don\u2019t know man. I haven\u2019t talked to her in like ten years.\n": "No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!\n", "You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred\u2026\n": "Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?\n", "Oh okay, I\u2019ll-I\u2019ll try.\n": "All right! Thanks! You\u2019re the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?\n", "Yeah so, Tuesday?\n": " Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!\n", " Thank you.\n": "Okay.\n", "You never run on a barge!\n": " Hey.\n", "No, umm, he met some girl at the coffee house.\n": "Oooh.\n", "Yeah, Ginger something.\n": "Nooo. No, no, ah, are you sure it wasn\u2019t something that sounded like Ginger, like ah, Gingeer?\n", "No, it was Ginger. I remember, because when he told me, I said,  \u2018the movie star.\u2019\n": "Aww, man. That\u2019s the girl I was hiding from. When she finds out he\u2019s my roommate, she\u2019s gonna tell him what I did.\n", "Well, what did you do?\n": "What, oh, oh, oh, no, no, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t tell you that, it\u2019s like the most awful, horrible thing I\u2019ve ever done my whole life.\n", "Y'know what, don\u2019t tell us. We\u2019ll just wait until Chandler gets home,  because it\u2019ll be more fun that way.\n": "All right!! Okay, it was like four years ago. Okay, Ginger and I had gone out a few times, and then this one weekend, we went up to her Dad\u2019s cabin. Just me, her, and her annoying little dog Pepper. Well that night, I cooked this really romantic dinner....\n", "You gave her food poisoning!?\n": "I wish. No. After dinner, me, her, and Pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire. Well I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw that the fire was dying out. So, I picked up a log and threw it on. Or, at least what I thought was a log.\n", "Oh my God!! You threw Pepper on the fire!\n": "I wish. See, I guess another thing I probably should\u2019ve told you about Ginger is that she kinda has a ah, artificial leg.\n", " ...spender.\n": "She's still asleep.\n", "So how'd it go?\n": "Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?\n", "The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.\n": "Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!\n", "Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route.\n": "It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level.\n", "Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.\n": "I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.\n", "No way, forget it.\n": "C'mon, she's your mom!\n", "I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn\u2019t ask me to go do it with her in the vault.\n": "Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!\n", "What, no, \"Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?\"\n": "Noo! Nothing!\n", "Y\u2019know what, we have to turn off the porn.\n": "I think you\u2019re right.\n", "Two.\n": "That\u2019s kinda nice.\n", "Yeah, that\u2019s kinda a relief.\n": "Yeah.\n", "You wanna see if we still have it?\n": "Yeah.\n", "FREE PORN!!!\n": "Yeah!!\n", "Listen. Listen.  Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you? \n": "Wow, Pheebs! That sounds great!\n", "So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.\n": "That\u2019s so sweet.  I\u2019m gonna get some coffee. \n", " Would you put that back on?! Monica\u2019s gonna be here any minute!\n": "But it hurt\u2019s my Joey\u2019s Apple.\n", "Yeah, check out the ring. \n": "Oh my God!!\n", "You-you\u2019re gonna get married?! I mean\u2026 We\u2019re gonna be brothers-in-law! \n": "And-and-and-and-and-and, and we\u2019re gonna be friends again! \n", " Heyyyy\u2014What?\n": "Oh it\u2019s water under the bridge, forget it!\n", "Okay!  I was gonna wait \u2018til uh, it was official y\u2019know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you\u2019re my best friends.\n": "I think I\u2019m gonna cry!\n", "What happened?\n": "We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that I\u2019ll be there as soon as I can.\n", "Joey, why would you do that?\n": "Because they wanted me to audition!\n", "Hmm.\n": "Hey. \n", "Yeah, or, or, or, Mississ-Pete.\n": "Oh, oh, I got it! Pete-Chicago.\n", "That\u2019s not a state Joe.\n": "Oh, and Mississ-Pete is?\n", " What was that?\n": "What?\n", "You just did a little dancy thing.\n": "No I didn\u2019t.\n", "You are soo enjoying this.\n": "No, I\u2019m not! And it wasn\u2019t a hop it was a pademarie. \n", " You know the words! You are so into this!\n": "All right, well maybe I\u2019m enjoying it a little bit. I mean I\u2019m getting pretty good at it.\n", "Ooh, this is soo sweet, Joey our little twinkle-toes.\n": "Hey-hey, hold on, this isn\u2019t some kind of like girly dance. All right, it\u2019s like a sport, it\u2019s manly!\n", " You want me to kick you guys out instead?\n": "No you can\u2019t do that, where would the chick and the duck live?\n", " You have pets!\n": "Noo-no-no, no, those are nicknames. I\u2019m the chick and Chandler is the duck.\n", " Huh, I would\u2019ve thought it was the other way around.\n": "Come on man, just-just let the girls stay, I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\n", " Really? You\u2019ll do anything?\n": "Yeah-yeah, absolutely.\n", " Yeah, I\u2019ve got something you can do.\n": "What, what is it?\n", " What did you do?\n": "What \u2018cha doing?\n", "Having a swim.\n": "What about the chick?\n", "Chicks don\u2019t swim.\n": "Are you sure?\n", "I don\u2019t know. Should we try it?\n": "Sure.\n", "See, I told you they don\u2019t swim. \n": " Wait. Give him a minute.\n", "Ye-e-es!!\n": " Hey.\n", "I need two. I\u2019m bringing Pete. My boyfriend. I have a boyfriend now!\n": "Two it is. Ross, how about you?\n", "No. No, not at all, not at all. I actually was gonna bring someone myself, so\u2026\n": "But you said one.\n", "I meant, me plus one!\n": "Okay.  Did ah, you guys mean you plus one?\n", "All right, I\u2019ll see you tonight.\n": "Okay.\n", "Okay, I need a date! \n": "Oh, hey, you guys are finally gonna get to meet Kate!\n", "Yeah, and I don\u2019t have any cologne.\n": "The green bottle next to the shaving cream.\n", "Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.\n": "Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't\u2014I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.\n", "Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out.  We will, we will, call you back!\n": "Hey, all right!\n", "Pretty cool, huh?\n": " You're fake laughing too, right?\n", "Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you. \n": "Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!\n", "Hi\n": "Yeah, she's gonna live with me!\n", "Lecroix. Janine Lecroix\n": "I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!\n", "Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.\n": " From the land down under? I didn't know that either!\n", "I'm a dancer.\n": "You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!\n", "Well, I think I'll go and unpack.\n": "Oh, hey let me. \n", "Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?\n": "Of course I did.\n", "Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?\n": "\"When can you move in?\"\n", "Hey, look at all the boxes!\n": "Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!\n", "All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?\n": "Oh God, yeah.\n", "Now imagine you live at the supermarket.\n": " Okay!\n", "No-no\n": "Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!\n", "Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.\n": "Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.\n", "Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!\n": "OW, why, why, why?\n", "Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!\n": "Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.\n", "Mandy.\n": "Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?\n", "Do you think I'm someone else?\n": "Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?\n", "Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!\n": " Growth!\n", "Fine, I'll give you her number.\n": "Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one.  Mandy.\n", "SARAH!\n": "Saraaah.\n", "Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress. \n": "I can see why, nice shirt!\n", "Oh, yeah! You like \u2018em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!\n": "Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.\n", "Uhh, a T-shirt that says, \"I don\u2019t belong here.\"\n": "You have Knicks tickets?\n", "Yeah, what, do you think we\u2019re stupid?\n": "You\u2019re not stupid. You\u2019re meaner than I thought.\n", "We don\u2019t know what could make this go away.\n": "Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!\n", "And no one touches the air around the TV!\n": "Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?\n", "We still have porn.\n": "Hey.\n", "You mean like a doctor?\n": "Pheebs! You\u2019re blocking the porn! Look out!\n", "What did you do to his sweater vests?\n": "Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.\n", "Hey, dude!\n": "Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?\n", "Now you do that, you\u2019re on TV.\n": "Hey!\n", "She\u2019s made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.\n": "Well all right then, I guess I shouldn\u2019t get to excited about the fact  that I just kissed her!\n", "You kissed her.\n": "Oh we kissed it up real nice.\n", "So you kissed her, so what happened after that?\n": "I came over here to tell you guys.\n", "No, we just went out.\n": "You're smart. I like that.\n", "Oh, candles!  What is that? A blanket? A video camera? Oh my God! \n": "Oh no-no-no-no, wait-wait-wait!!\n", "I can't believe you thought that you were going to video tape us having sex on the first date! \n": "Hiya.\n", "Yeah?  Well this is not what I ordered.\n": " Hey guys!\n", "Shocking! Since you still have the keys.\n": "You should see the treatment I get when I\u2019m with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.\n", "What equity investments?\n": "The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up!  But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, they\u2019re gonna start to think that I don\u2019t own it. So I figured I\u2019ll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?\n", "You are way off, pal.\n": "No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her.\n", "That really is something; that's really cool.\n": "Howdy partner!\n", "Hey, uh, Joey?\n": "Umm?\n", "Remember that big thing I was gonna tell you about?\n": "Oh, no! \n", "I'm not gonna tell you, but if you found out on your own, that would be okay and then we could talk about it. Right?\n": "Well, then it wouldn't be a secret. So yeah, that would be okay. Yeah. Yeah!\n", " Yeah. Well.  Hey uh Joe, would mind going over to Chandler's bedroom and get that book back that he borrowed from me?\n": "Now? You want me to go over there now?\n", "Do you know something?\n": "I might know something.\n", "I might know something too.\n": "What's the thing you know?\n", "Oh no, I can't tell you until you tell me what you know.\n": "I can't tell you what I know.\n", "Well then I can't tell you what I know.\n": "Okay, fine.\nYou don't know!\n", "All right, how about I go over there and I will walk into Chandler's bedroom and I will see that thing that I think that I know is actually the thing that I think that I know! \n": " YOU KNOW!!!!\n", "AND YOU KNOW!!!\n": "Yeah, I know!!!!\n", "Chandler and Monica?!! Oh, this is unbelievable!! How long have you known?\n": "Too long! Oh my God, Rach, I've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long! Listen, listen, we can't say anything about this to anybody, they're so weird about that! Listen\u2026 \n", "Hey! It's raining. I don't want to fly in the rain. So\u2026\n": "Oh, I am going to go for a walk in the rain.\n", "Oh, can I play too? I\u2019ve never played football, like ever. \n": "Great, you can cover Chandler.\n", "No, no, no, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t really wanna play.\n": "Come on man! You never want to do anything since you and Janice broke up.\n", "That\u2019s not true! I wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day. I wanted to start drinking in the morning. Don\u2019t say that I don\u2019t have goals!\n": "Chandler, you have to start getting over her. All right, if you play, you get some fresh air, maybe it\u2019ll take your mind off Janice, and if you don\u2019t play, everyone will be mad at you \u2018cause the teams won\u2019t be even. Come on.\n", "Um, Monica and I aren\u2019t supposed to play football.\n": "Says who? Your mom?\n", "\u2018Kay!\n": "Can I ask you something?\n", "Uhh, no.\n": "Felicity and I, we\u2019re watching My Giant, and I was thinking, \"I\u2019m never gonna be as good an actor as that giant.\" Do you think I\u2019m just wasting my life with this acting thing?\n", "Okay man. \n": "But what about how much taller he is than me?\nI mean, there\u2019s no way I can make myself taller now, y\u2019know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?\nHey, Monica, wow you\u2019ve been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.\n", "Welcome everybody, welcome to Amazing Discoveries!\n": "You guys, can we please not watch this all right.\n", "Folks, has this ever happened to you. You go to the refrigerator to get a nice glass of milk,  and these darn cartons are so flingin'-flangin' hard to open.\n": " Oh, you said it Mike.  Aw! There's got to be a better way!\n", "Keep in mind, he's never used this product before, you're gonna see how easy this is to do.  Go ahead.  This works with any milk carton.\n": " Wow, it is easy.  Now, I can have milk everyday.\n", "Oh, no! \n": "Oh hey, don't worry. I'm still ordained from your wedding.\n", "Uhm, ministers don't ride the subway for free.\n": "I had to read the Bible pretty carefully, but... yeah we do.\n", "Na-ah.\n": "Friends, family, dog... Thank you all for being here to witness this blessed event. The cold has now spread to my special place... so I'm gonna do the short version of this. Phoebe and Mike are perfect for each other. And I know I speak for every one here... when I wish them a lifetime of happiness. Who has the rings?\n Okay...\n", "Uh Joey...\n": "Yeah?\n", "Chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.\n": "Oh, okay. Phoebe, do you take this man to be your husband?\n", "Yes that was mine.\n": "'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.\n", "I gotta tell ya, I think it\u2019s okay to be that guy.\n": "Yeah, maybe it\u2019s like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.  \n", "Okay, can we please go eat?\n": "Yeah. What are we getting?\n", "All right so, Chandler, from now on, don\u2019t give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don\u2019t turn your back to him.\n": "Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell.  Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?\n", "I can\u2019t help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.\n": "All right look, y\u2019know how-y\u2019know how when you\u2019re dating someone and you don\u2019t want to cheat on them, unless it\u2019s with someone really hot?\n", "Yeah, totally!\n": "All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you\u2019re going to do something wrong,  do it right!\nFeel better now?\n", "Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I\u2019m gonna eat like, y\u2019know millions of cows.\n": "Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.\n", "Joey, I can\u2019t believe you would do that for me.\n": "Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There\u2019s no meat in beer, right?\n", "I think you\u2019re done.\n": "Okay, time to take off the bra. \n", "Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.\n": " Take the bra off.\n", "Oh, just this!  Y\u2019know what it\u2019s my fault really, because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish.\n": " Hey, does somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles.\n", "Amy!\n": " \"\u2026Amy! Happy birthday to you!\"\n", " \"\u2026Amy! Happy birthday to you!\"\n": "Yeah, not it here it isn\u2019t.\n", "Nice!\n": "Nice!! Yeah! Is that part of your resolution, your new thing for today?\n", "Horn-swoggle.\n": "You all right Chandler? Is there something funny about that name?\n", "No. No, I just think that maybe I-I'd heard it somewhere before. \n": "Oh really! Where? Somewhere funny I'd bet! \n", "All right, see you later.\n": "See ya! All right Pheebs, I am ready for my first lesson. \n", "Okay.  Oh no-no-no, you don't touch the guitar! First you learn here,  then you learn here. \n": "Umm, okay.\n", "All right, gentlemen, you\u2019re up first.\n": "Okay.\n", "You have 30 seconds. And the lightning round begins\u2014stop it \u2014now. What was Monica\u2019s nickname when she was a field hockey goalie?\n": "Big fat goalie.\n", "Eww! No!! Her ear!

Man those   horses can crap. \n", "Joey's eyes become large and he stands up>\n": "Oh my God!\n", "Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime   soap Days of Our Lives? \n": "Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I   can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. \n", "What are you going to do?\n": "I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really   good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me.   They sat us all down yesterday and said \"Everyone has to be there at 6:00   AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani.\" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot. \n", "Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!\n": "Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs! <motions her to   come over> \n", "Hey, what's going on Joe? \n": "I.. I.. I need a good lie.\n", "Oh okay. How about the whole \"man walking on   the moon\" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people! \n": "No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't   at a work thing today.\n", "Ooh, honey. You stink at lying. \n": "I do not.\n", "Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday   at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin   was gone-who took it?\n": "Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a   raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said \"Hey   don't eat that-that's Phoebe's\" and he said.. <pause> He said.. \"Joey   you stink at lying.\" What am I going to do? \n", "Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good   lie. I'll help you practice it.\n": "Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you. \n", "Sure, what.. what was the work thing? \n": "Uh.. <forgetting what the work thing was, rolls   up his sleeve on his right arm and shows Phoebe, she looks>\n", "\"Pick up grandma at the airport\"?\n": "Oh.. man..\n", "Monica and Amy turn away and walk into the living room towards the secret   closet>\n": "Pheebs, I still need some help here\n", "Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell.   but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when   you're talking, people know you're lying. \n": "Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know..   I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor. \n", "oss makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.\n": "Hey!

And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was\u2014if she was kidding was very funny.

What's up?\n": "Maybe you can tell me. My agent would like to know why I didn't show up at the audition I didn't know I had today. The first good thing she gets me in weeks. How could you not give me the message?!\n", "Yes, it was! It was him! Uh huh!  Okay, it was me! \n": "How is it you?\n", "Well, it was just, it was all so crazy, you know. I mean, Chandler was in the closet, counting to 10, and he was up to 7 and I hadn't found a place to hide yet. I-I-I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all down on my hand. See, all of it. \n": "Yep, that's my audition.\n", "What is the great tragedy here? You go get yourself another appointment.\n": "Well, Estelle tried, you know. The casting director told her that I missed my chance.\n", "That is unfair. I'll call her and tell her it was totally my fault.\n": "Pheebs, you can't do that. The casting director doesn't talk to friends, she only talks to agents.\n", "What a sad little life she must lead. Okay, ooh . \n": "What, what are you doing? What are you doing?\n", "No, no, no, I know, I know, ooh.  'Hi, this is Katelynn, from Phoebe Buffay's office. Um, is um, Ann there for Phoebe, she'll know what it's about.'\n": "Hang up, hang up. \n", " Helloo! Oh! \n": "Pheebs! There you are!\n", "No it's not, sorry.\n": "But Phoebe, wait! Wait! Phoebe.

They called and you didn't get it! Okay, I mean you didn't get it, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n": "It's okay, these things happen.\n", "But they shouldn't happen, you know what, you're, you're in a terrible, terrible business. Oh God, I don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that.\n": "I'm, I'm okay. See. \n", "Oh, now you're sad and creepy, oh. You know what, I, I'm sorry I quit, okay, I just quit.\n": "No! No, no you can't quit! You're the best agent I ever had! Look Pheebs, rejection is part being an actor, you can't take it personally.\n", "Not personal, really, well they said that they never met an Italian actor with a worse Italian accent.\n": "They actually said that?\n", "Yeah. Ooh God, there's that face again! See I can't do this job! I...\n": "No, no, no, see that's why you have to do this job, agents always lie. You know, Estelle just says stuff like 'They went another way', but this, I can use this.  I canna work on a new accent.\n", "Well, my eye is a little itchy.\n": "Uhhh, mine too! Yeah.\n", "Chandler!\n": "Me too! Me too! Me too!  \n", "You okay there man?\n": "Yeah, I got too excited!\n", "Hey, how'd it go?\n": "Excellent.\n", "Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.\n": "Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear.  \n", "What about my cab?\n": "I don\u2019t need that anymore.\n", "No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.\n": "I don\u2019t want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely.  Oh\u2014ooh! How about you come with me?\n", "I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s such a long trip.\n": "It\u2019ll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.\n", "Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?\n": "Sure?\n", "Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.\n": "Where is the waitress?! I\u2019m starving!\n", "It\u2019s a buffet man.\n": "Oh, here\u2019s where I win all my money back! \n", "Listen, I gotta talk to you.\n": "Sure! What\u2019s up? \n", "Monica and I almost got married last night.\n": "Oh my God! That\u2019s huge!  Wait a minute, why come I wasn\u2019t invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don\u2019t say, \"Ross.\" Do not say, \"Ross.\"\n", "Look, I just don\u2019t think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y\u2019know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y\u2019know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?\n": "Oh! Tell her she\u2019s not marriage material.\n", "Laugh it up, but the joke\u2019s on you. Because we don\u2019t need to get divorced, okay? We we\u2019re just gonna get an annulment. \n": "An annulment? Ross! I don\u2019t think surgery\u2019s the answer here.\n", "So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.\n": "Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I\u2019m not even sure I got it.\n", "Well, if you want, you can work here.\n": "Uh, I don\u2019t know. Ya see, it\u2019s just, see I was a regular on a soap opera y\u2019know? And to go from that to this, I just\u2026 Plus, I\u2019d have to wait on all my friends.\n", "Okay, but the money\u2019s good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.\n": "What?!\n", "So the going for help went well?\n": "Oh yeah, Smokey Joe here got half way to the highway and collapsed.\n", "Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?\n": " Oh man! I thought I got it all!\n", " How...how...?\n": "I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right? \n", "uh-huh\n": "And I couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very! \n", " Wow...definitely just Drake...\n": "What?\n", "What...how is it going with Drake?\n": "Oh...I don't think it's going very well...\n", "What...that scene I saw was so good!\n": "Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...\n", "Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?\n": "A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.\n", "Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?\n": "Uh...well...just once...with you...\n", "Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?\n": " What the hell are you talking about??\n", " Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how  you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.\n": " Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.\n", " Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...\n": "Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know?  And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful...  and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.\n Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!!  Closing credits \n Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! \n", "Yeah me too.\n": "Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?\n", "Didn\u2019t it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?\n": "I know what it did! Nothing.\n", "They wouldn\u2019t have put it there if it didn\u2019t do something! How can you not care?\n": "Like this. \n", "Well, here\u2019s another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?\n": "Sure! It flushes it.\n", "Yeah, I\u2019m riding the alimony pony. \n": "And there it is.\n", "Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality\u2014Well, they\u2019re all back! Y\u2019know? And she\u2019s picked up like nine new ones!\n": "So what are you doing bringing her here?! There\u2019s people here!\n", "I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and I'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.\n": "Nice. Oh hey, what about Ross?\n", " Joey, I uh! I can't believe this is how I'm spending my anniversary.\n": "All right well, I'll take you someplace nice then. Look! A guy tipped me a hundred bucks today.\n", "Whoa!\n": "Yeah-yeah, he was playing blackjack for like an hour and he won $5,000. Can you believe that? $5,000!\n", "Y'know, if I won $5,000 I'd join a gym, y'know build up my upper body and hit Richard from behind with a stick! \n": "Wait a minute! Why don't I do what that guy did? I'll take this $100 and turn it into $5,000! And then I'll turn that into enough money to get my movie going again!\n", "Good luck! \n": "Chandler! I don't need luck. I have thought this through!\n", "Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.\n": "Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.\n", "Back on in 30 seconds people!\n": "Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?\n", "Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.\n": "Come on man! You've been here all day!\n", "I don\u2019t see any reason why I would do that to myself again.\n": "Either eat it, or be in it.\n", "I\u2019m torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal. \n": "Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there\u2019s a new class comin\u2019 in.\n", " 3, 2, 1.  Happy New Year.\n": "Oh, yoii. What was that for?\n", "Well, I don\u2019t know tonight when they yelled cut and we didn\u2019t get to kiss, I was really, really, disappointed, and I just, really wanted to kiss you\n": "Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment.\n", "In the moment, yeah.\n": "But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?\n", "Sure, New Year\u2019s Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?\n": "No.\n", "Me neither.\n": "3, 2, \n", "Joey, you don\u2019t have to count down every time we kiss.\n": "Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready.\n", "That sounds great!\n": " Hey! \n", "Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You can\u2019t eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.\n": " There\u2019s gravy?\n", "Nooo. And there\u2019s really no reason he should find out, so ah let\u2019s not make a big deal about it, okay?\n": "What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can\u2019t tell me last night didn\u2019t mean something to you. I-I was there, you\u2019re not that good an actress.\n", "Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That\u2019s all it was. Joey, I\u2019m-I\u2019m sorry you feel bad, but haven\u2019t you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?\n": "Nooo.\n", "Hi, Lauren.\n": "Hi, Lauren.\n", "Catch any big fish? \n": "Oh my God, you guys have no idea. \n", "Are you kidding?!\n": "Yeah, three days on the lake without a shower.

You ruined it!  \n", "I\u2019m fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.\n": " Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don\u2019t know\u2026 \n", "Well, you'll have to wait your turn. \n": "Well, how long do you think it'll be? \n", "Oh hey, hey, huh, how about this weekend we have a laser disc marathon okay, and maybe a tournament on my new dart board?

No! I\u2026knew\u2026you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!\n", "When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.\n": "Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.\n", "From a bullet!\n": "I know it doesn't make much sense\u2026\n", "Much sense?!\n": "Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!\n", "So you risked your life, for a sandwich!\n": "I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world!\n", "So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.\n": "No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!\n", " Oh-oi-ho, yeah!\n": "See?\n", "Hm-hmm. \n": "Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!\n", "She's putting words in your mouth!\n": "Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!\n", "Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.\n": "I guess I'm done.\n", "Guys, rules are good!

Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}\n": "It's not a cat!\n", " Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?\n": "Uhh, the ball thing.\n", "Uhh, yeah it would!

And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.\n", " Okay.  Joey, trade lives with me!\n": "Nope.  Man look at this! Ross, I can\u2019t believe you said you\u2019d play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!\n", "That\u2019s \u2018cause-\u2018cause you\u2019re mom\u2019s dog kept-kept looking at me.\n": " Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That\u2019s called a scrum, okay? It\u2019s kinda like a huddle.\n", "And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?\n": "Ross!  They\u2019re gonna kill you!\n", " I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right, you are a tough guy. You\u2019re the toughest palaeontologist I know.\n": "All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It\u2019s not like he\u2019s\u2026Chandler!\n", "No thank you.\n": "Wait-wait-wait-wait!  Come on! Come on, let\u2019s trade! The timing\u2019s perfect, I just clogged the toilet! \n", "Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can\u2019t leave in the small apartment after we\u2019ve lived here! Didn\u2019t you ever read Flowers for Algernon?\n": "Yes! Didn\u2019t you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn\u2019t read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!\n", "Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.\n": "It\u2019s the Knicks!\n", "Screw the Knicks!\n": "Whoa!\n", "I didn\u2019t mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.\n": "Huh.\n", "And the Knicks rule all.\n": "Yeah, the Knicks rule all!\n", "All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?\n": "Done!\n", "Let me finish. \n": "Oh. \n", "I\u2019m talking about a bet, winner takes all.\n": "Ooh, we could end up with nothing.\n", "Or you could end up with everything.\n": "Ooh, I like that.\n", "Op, op, I\u2019m convinced!\n": "Come on man, you know I\u2019d do it for you! Because, you\u2019re my best friend.\n", "All right, but you can\u2019t use that again for a whole year. I\u2019m in.\n": "All right!\n", "Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh\u2014oh, I have a game!\n": "Okay! \n", "This is great!\n": "What\u2019s the game?! What\u2019s the game?!\n", "Good! Good!

Phoebe, you look, I can\u2019t.\n", "What make you think I can?! \n": "Okay. Okay.  Ace!\n", "Because we won our apartment back!\n": "What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!\n", "All right, cut, let\u2019s pick again, pick again.\n": "Okay.\n", "Come on apartment! Come on apartment!  Oh! I know queen is high!\n": "Uh-huh, not as high as\u2026 It worked! King!\n", "But, we pick again! We pick again!\n": "Why?!\n", "Tickets please!  That\u2019s courtside baby!\n": "Seriously, good game though. Good game.   What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!\n", "I mean, all I\u2019m asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don\u2019t I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!\n": "Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It\u2019s like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie\u2019s!! \n", "Maybe not even then. \n": "Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had   a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie   Pheebs.\n", "Bye plates!\n": "Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh? \n", "What? Something happened with the plates?\n": "Uhm...  Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came   in...\n", "Yes! A friend of mine did it and it\u2019s totally legal!\n": "I call it!!\n", "Guys thank you very much but neither of you is marrying us.\n": "Does calling it not mean anything anymore?!\n", "Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!\n": "Well uh, she didn\u2019t want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I\u2019m so sorry.\n", "Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!\n": "Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.\n", "And I am not blah, I am a hoot!\n": "I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don\u2019t-don\u2019t be mad. I\u2019m sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y\u2019know? And it was our first date! Plus, she\u2019s really sick!\n", "No, you sh\u2014No you said you made that up!!\n": "I know, but don\u2019t you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?\n", "Eh, they\u2019re both good. I generally just go with, Monica\u2019s drunk again.  \n": "Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She\u2019ll come around I promise.\n", " I do not like that woman!\n": " I can hear you!\n", "Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning    on staying at    home with your child... \n": " Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity?        OW!\n", "Good to see you again!\n": "It\u2019s been a while, huh? Wow, it\u2019s funny these halls look smaller then they used to.\n", "It\u2019s a different building.\n": "So! Stryker Remoray huh? When do you want me to start?\n", "Why don\u2019t we start right now!\n": "Okay.\n", "Here are the audition scenes. \n": " Audition? I thought you were gonna offer me the part.\n", "Why would you think that?\n": "Well, I was Dr. Drake Remoray, Stryker\u2019s twin brother. I mean, who looks more me than me right?\n", "Everybody has to audition.\n": "Y\u2019know Terry, I-I don\u2019t really need to do this. I got my own cable TV series,  with a robot.\n", "Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!\n": "Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!\n", "I don't know, clean places?\n": "Umm, yum!\n", "Well it\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s one of those situations that I just hate. Y\u2019know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.\n": " Now you\u2019re thinking you gotta sleep with him.\n", "I\u2019ll give up my ticket.\n": "Me too.\n", "It\u2019s mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.\n": "Oh man! \n", "That's not funny.\n": "That's not funny at all!\n", "That's not funny at all!\n": "Hey!\n", "Oh, we wanted to finish the crossword before we went to bed. Hey, do you know a six-letter word for red?\n": " Dark red.\n", " Yes, you are so smart! \n": "Aww, you guys are so cute!\n", "Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid\u2019s pretzel at them.\n": "Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.\n", "Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.\n": "Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....\n", "Well, that was ah...\n": "Better?\n", "Yeah! Yeah, it was definitely an improvement. G\u2019night.\n": "Ah, Kate? \n", " I\u2019m probably gonna need those. Huh? \n": "Hey, listen you ah....\n", "Okay now it doesn\u2019t matter which one you choose, y\u2019know? It\u2019s completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.\n": " Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!\n", "Okay sure!\n": "Really?!\n", "Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.\n": "Call it even?\n", "Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girl\u2019s bodies, waking up next to people you don\u2019t even know\u2026\n": "Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?\n", "You know the hotels?\n": "Sure! I was there! Spring Break \u201981! Woo-hoo!\n", "In 1981 you were 13!\n": "So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And y\u2019know who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.\n", " Can I get some ice here?!\n": "Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.\n", "You\u2019re not the fan who\u2019s dying are you?\n": "Say what?\n", "I\u2019m supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that\u2019s not supposed to be until  later!\n": "No. No, I\u2019m Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I\u2019m the guy in the coma!\n", "Oh that was a real person?!\n": "An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I\u2019m getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me\u2026\n", "I-I-I\u2019m leaving the show?\n": " I don\u2019t know. Why? Did you hear something?\n", "Who told you that?\n": "Oh uh, one of the writers.\n", "Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?\n": "Umm\u2026\n", "Y\u2019know what? It doesn\u2019t matter! Because it is not true!\n": "Okay.\n", "Remember? You-you were eating pizza.\n": "Yeah.\n", "Okay. Well, apparently Chandler\u2019s angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.\n": "Oh, we\u2019re supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!\n", "Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y\u2019know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.\n": "Oh wow that\u2019s a great idea! And I still have his credit card.\n", "Oh.  \n": "Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go.  Y\u2019know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just\u2014I don\u2019t get Chandler. Y\u2019know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don\u2019t get all upset.\n", "It's the\u2014Chandler!!\n": " Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!\n", "Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?\n": "Oh-ho, yeah!\n", "Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?\n": "Yep!\n", "Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.\n": " Yeah okay.  Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.\n", "Your tax dollars?\n": "Yeah, okay.\n", " Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.\n": "Did I say you could smell it?!\n", "I can't smell your sandwich?\n": "Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!\n", "Okay, I'll give them back.  Look! What is so great about that sandwich?\n": "Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.\n", "To the bank.\n": "Sperm or regular?\n", "Sperm.\n": "So you're really doing this, huh?\n", "Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135. \n": "Sounds nice.\n", "'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes...\n": "No kiddin', hmm. \n", "Really? Why?\n": "I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt.\n", "Hoyt?\n": "It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool.\n", "Really, is he a swimmer?\n": "He's got the body for it.\n", "I like that.  What?\n": "You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know.\n", "We do not have one of those signs.\n": "Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids.\n", "Two girls and a boy?\n": "Yeah!\n", "And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them.\n": "Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too. \n", " Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?\n": "No-no-no-no-no,  I'm not fallin' for that again.\n", "Almost over man.\n": " Look! Oh!  Is that the Pope?! \n", "Why am I looking?\n": "Oh, here I am, here's my big scene!\n All right back off! I gotta gun! I'm not afraid to use it!\n", "You couldn't have at least changed your shirt.\n": " Now, I wanna a suitcase filled with 100,000 dollars.  Choo! Choo! Choo!  Filled with $100,000 in small bills, and if I don't get it\u2026 Choo!! And if I don't get it,  I'm gonna shoot this duck!\n", "Oh no!\n": " I'm comin' out! \n", " Ground control to Major Tom! Commencing countdown\u2026engines\u2026on!\n": " That's uh, scenes from next week's show. Next week's!\n", "I'm good!\n": "Can I offer you a drink?\n", "Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with    the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword    for a friend's book...\n": "Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to    open a door and go  ohhhh!\n", "So I am just so excited to be    here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!\n": "Hey, if you need a tour guide... \n", "Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!\n": "Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?\n", "Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher    Hall.\n": " Ok!\n", "And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display    at the public library.\n": "I know, yeah!\n", "And first, I have to see the MET!\n": "Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna    see the Yankees.\n", "No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!\n": "Which one, they all suck!\n", "I wanna say a disease.\n": " Hey!\n", "Oh-oh Professor Geller.\n": "Ahh, to be 13 again.\n", "You\u2019ve got to get out of here! Save yourself!\n": "No! I won\u2019t leave you!\n", "Don\u2019t worry about me, I\u2019m a robot! I\u2019m just a machine!!\n": "No you\u2019re not! Not to me!\n", "I am extremely talented!\n": "Yeah, you\u2019re great! Okay, let\u2019s take it from\u2026\n", " No, I mean I was really acting my ass off.\n": "Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too.\n", "Oh yeah, you\u2019re solid. Yeah, you\u2019re just no me.\n": "Y\u2019know what? I think that\u2019s enough for now. Yeah. I don\u2019t want to be over rehearsed.\n", "We all chipped in.\n": " We did?\n", " \u2026there\u2019s gonna be a wedding!  That\u2019s unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love!  \u2026constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision. \n": " Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions!  What gives you the right to\u2026  Go to hell!  Stupid guy on my phone.\nHey Rach listen, did you know that during pregnancy your fingers swell up to twice their size and never go back.\n", " Oh my\u2026God! Let me see that! \n": " You fall for it every time!\n", "Oh, and by the way, he\u2019s lost a bunch of weight. I mean he looks goo-ood! Okay, I mean really, really gorgeous!  I still love Chandler.\n": "I just want you to say it once in a while.\n", "All right okay, just so you know, I\u2019m not gonna make a turkey this year.\n": "What?!\n", "Well Phoebe doesn\u2019t eat turkey\u2026\n": "Phoebe!\n", "Turkey\u2019s are beautiful, intelligent animals!\n": "No they\u2019re not! They\u2019re ugly and stupid and delicious!\n", "All right! Okay, it\u2019s just Phoebe. Will\u2019s still on a diet, Chandler doesn\u2019t eat Thanksgiving food, and Rachel\u2019s having her aversion to poultry.\n": "She is?\n", "Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?\n": "Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.\n", "Anyway, it just doesn\u2019t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people. Okay? It\u2019s a lot of work.\n": "But you gotta have turkey on Thanksgiving! I mean, Thanksgiving with no turkey is like-like Fourth of July with no apple pie! Or Friday with no two pizzas!\n", "All right fine! If it means that much to you! But just\u2014there\u2019s gonna be a ton left over.\n": "No there won\u2019t! I promise I will finish that turkey!\n", "All right, you\u2019re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting?\n": "That\u2019s right! \u2018Cause I\u2019m a Tribbiani!  And this is what we do! I mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders, we don\u2019t read a lot or run very fast, but damnit! We can eat!\n", "Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.\n": "It's 4:30.\n", "Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.\n": "Okay, I see what's going on here.\n", "You-you do?\n": "Yeah! You don't like Kathy.\n", "Yeah. Right.\n": "Good, and hey! My treat.  But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?\n", "Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for    firing me.\n": " Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?\n", "Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...\n": "No, no, no!  Don't drop by,    don't drop by!\n", "Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.\n": "Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?\n", " It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with    the career. You're gonna be huge.\n": "Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye.     \"out of area\". Boy, I'll say.\n", "Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.\n": " So, er... how did it go with Celia?\n", "Oh, I was unbelievable.\n": "All right, Ross!\n", "I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.\n": "Whoa! And the...  huh-huh?\n", "Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...\n": "You cuddled.\n", "Uh, I think I just did. And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!\n": "Rach?\n", "Joey, we had a deal. That-that\u2019s why you\u2019re here! I\u2019ve got to fire you!\n": "And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You don\u2019t fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and they\u2019ll start listening to all the nice things I\u2019ve been saying about you.\n", "Oh thanks!\n": "Yeah. What time are you meeting her?\n", "We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.\n": "Wow, that\u2019s in like 20 minutes. You\u2019d better get dressed.\n", "I am dressed.\n": "Oh. Well good!  For me.  What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?\n", "I have an oily T-zone!\n": "Okay dude!  Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.\n", "Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn\u2019t break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.\n": "Oh-oh! So that\u2019s the way it\u2019s gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y\u2019know!\n", "Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?\n": "I don\u2019t know.\n", "Why am I not surprised?\n": "Y\u2019know what Ross? I\u2019m not gonna let you get away with this!\n", "I don\u2019t think you have much choice.\n": "Well we\u2019ll see!\n", "Bye-bye!\n": "Yeah bye-bye!  Hey! So just a light layer?\n", "It's off the resum\u00e9. \nArchery?\n": "No.\n", "Horseback riding?\n": "Would fall off a lot.\n", "You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?\n": "That I can do.\n", "Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?\n": "All right, watch me!  Okay, you time me. Ready?\n", "Ooh! \n": " Guess what?  I finally got that seed out of my teeth.\n", "And this is Duncan  and Erin, they\u2019re gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let\u2019s get the camera rolling.\n": " Rightie-O Ray!\n", "Whenever you\u2019re ready.\n": " Hello, I\u2019m Joey Tribbiani! Let\u2019s play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?\n", "Wayne Gretzky.\n": "Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?\n", "Uh Joey, didn\u2019t your agents give you the revised rules? We\u2019ve eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.\n": "What\u2014Why?!\n", "Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn\u2019t follow it.\n": "Well what\u2019s complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You\u2019re in Paradise Pond!\n", "Yeah all that\u2019s gone. It\u2019s basically just a simple question and answer game now.\n": "Well what\u2019s fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that\u2019s just people standing around answering questions?\n", " Oh my God, everything is such a mess. Why is this happening to me? \n": " How bad do you want to stick your tongue on that? \n", "I\u2019m reading your ad.\n": "Looks good, uh?\n", "Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?\n": "Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!\n", "All right look, I\u2019m changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.\n": "What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.\n", " Nooo.\n": "Oh. What do you do?\n", "Nothing. Nothing.\n": "What? What\u2019s wrong?\n", "No Dr. Skeptismo! I\u2019m sure. First of all, okay, there\u2019s the feeling.  Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt.  My Mother\u2019s favourite fish is Orange Roughy...  Cats....like....fish!   Hi, Mommy.  Oh, I haven\u2019t seen this smile in 17 years!\n": " Dude, Phoebe\u2019s mom has got a huge peni...\n", "Joey, you have to tell her what\u2019s going on! And what did it look like?!\n": "I didn\u2019t look at it. Stupid baby\u2019s head was blocking most of it.\n", "Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.\n": "Look, it\u2019s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me.

What's mine is yours. \n", " Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?\n": "Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.\nHow about those fries though, huh? \n", "They are delicious \n": " You are beautiful, you know that?\n", "Oh, that is so sweet..\n": "Oh  okay.. \n NOW look what you did!!\n", "What? what is the matter with you?\n": "I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?\n", "But you just said \"What's mine is yours\"?\n": "WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!\n", "Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.\n": "I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean  There are things you do..and you now, things..  that you don't do . \n", "That\u2019s right. Get it out of your system while we\u2019re alone.\n": " Hey!\n", "And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today.  What? What?

Come here! \n", "Well I was gonna tell him that I\u2019m-I\u2019m gonna have the baby and he can be as involved as he wants.\n": "Well that, that sounds good.\n", "Yeah, bye.\n": "Bye.\n", " What?!  I am an excellent secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.\n": "What secrets?\n", "Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent secret keeper.\n": " You\u2019ll tell me later?\n", "Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!\n": "What did you say to him?\n", "What? No! It\u2019s not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.\n": "Really?\n", "Grammy, Best New Artist.\n": "Oh, hey listen! The Soapie\u2019s called today and I also get to present an award.\n", "Ohh that\u2019s great!\n": "Yeah!\n", "So you\u2019ll definitely get onstage, even if you don\u2019t win.\n": " What you-you don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna win?\n", "Well of course I do! But y\u2019know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you\u2019re up against the guy who survived his own cremation.\n": "Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it\u2019s just\u2026I\u2019ve never even been nominated before! I want it so much.\n", "Well Joey, you\u2019ll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y\u2019know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y\u2019know? So it\u2019s sorta like\u2026 \n": "Hey! \n", "Y\u2019know?\n": "You practice losing the Grammies too?\n", " Chandler?

These people are my friends; you can\u2019t treat them that way.\n", "They said stuff to me too, y\u2019know!\n": "I know! I know! And I\u2019m going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They\u2026 They\u2019re like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I\u2026 I don\u2019t think we can be together. It just, it just can\u2019t work. It can\u2019t.  I\u2019m very upset.\n", "Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?\n": "Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful!

I promise that\u2019s not gonna happen.\n", "Joey. Honey what would I do without you? \n": "You don\u2019t have to worry about that okay?\n", "Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They\u2019re right on that chair under Ross\u2019s coat.\n": "Sure.\n", "So uh\u2026I guess we should\u2026make it official huh?\n": "Uh\u2026 Look Rach\u2026 Hey Ross is here! Hey look!

Now, I look around this cafeteria, and y\u2019know what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, \"My God why?!\" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath.  I\u2019m Ross! I\u2019m divorced, and I have a kid!\n": " I\u2019m Joey! I\u2019m an actor! I don\u2019t know squat about dinosaurs!\n", "All right, there you go!\n": "Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!\n", " Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.  No, Andr\ufffd is not here.  Third time today.

This is like the last commercial. You've got like  ten minutes left!\n": "I know, I know! What am I going to do?  Ooh!\n", "No! You are not gonna run out and leave her here!\n": " Yeah, all right.  Ooh! \n", "I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby. \n": "Oh, I know how you feel...\n", "Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.\n": "I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!\n", "I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.\n": "But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?\n", "Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible? \n": "Alan. \n", "At his apartment. Is this juice?\n": "Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?\n", "Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.\n": "Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.\n", "I just get mad when Rachel doesn\u2019t remember where we\u2019re going.\n": "Where are you going?\n", "I can do that for the kids.\n": "Hey, y\u2019know what? I\u2019ll come too. I\u2019m making money now; it\u2019s about time I give something back.\n", "Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.\n": "Okay. Have a benefit.\n", "Uh-uh\u2014Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn\u2019t really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I\u2019m the one dating Elizabeth, not you!\n": "That\u2019s not what she said last night. \n", " So, a professor, uh?\n": "Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious    .  That's not    how she used it...?\n", "Yeah, I know the type.\n": "Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious.    No? Am I getting close?\n", "Do you have my credit card?\n": "Yes, it\u2019s in my\u2026 In\u2026in my pocket.   My back pocket!

Broken! That\u2019ll be $400!\n", "Joey, I saw you push him!\n": " You pushed him!\n", "Joey, I did not break this! Okay?  That has been broken for a while.\n": "All right. Chandler, do you remember how I told you about our fridge?\n", "And the place looks so nice!\n": "Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!\n", "Happy Thanksgiving!\n": "Well, this has been great!\n", "And who else is going to be there?\n": "Uh, some of her friends, yeah.\n", "Her dancer friends?\n": " Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they\u2019re gonna be, be drinkin\u2019 and dancin, and we really wanna go!\n", "Oh, but-but it is, uh, it\u2019s just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.\n": "Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!\n", " He\u2019s the headliner of a gay burlesque show.\n": "Rach, you\u2019re killin\u2019 us here, will ya serve the dessert already?

Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?\n": "Y-sure!\n", "Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!\n": "I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?\n", "Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!\n": " Chandler!\n", "Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd\u2019s Pie!\n": " Oh man! Now she\u2019s gonna start all over! We\u2019re never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!\n", "No, no, we will. We just won\u2019t tell her she messed up.\n": "Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?\n", "Yeah, it\u2019ll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!\n": " Vomiting stories are funny...\n", "Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!\n": "Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?\n", " Y\u2019know I think its great you wanted to meet here. Y\u2019know when most people hear the magazine is paying for it they want to go to a big fancy restaurant.\n": " Actually, I didn\u2019t know the magazine was paying for it. Wouldn\u2019t have mattered, I\u2019m doing this for the fans, not for the free food.\n", "Umm, I\u2019ll have a cup of coffee.\n": "And I\u2019ll have all the muffins.\n", "That's a pig.\n": "I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.\n", "What?! \n": "Why?\n", "Who needs a lease when it's family!\n": "Hey, you can stay with us!

What 'cha been doin'? \n", " Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?\n": "I don't know. But I can see through your sheet.  Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.\n", "What are you talking about?  She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!\n": "No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.\n", "Oh yeah it\u2019s fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.\n": " Kristen?\n", "Hi! What are you doing here?\n": "Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I\u2019m not breaking any rules so I\u2026\n", "Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.\n": "Hi!\n", "Yeah. So\u2026\n": "Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks! \n", "That\u2019s right!

Have you ever been married?\n", "That\u2019s right! Wait no, Ben.\n": "So you\u2019ve just married the one time then?\n", "You said the waiter ate my crab cake.\n": " Yeah. So uh Ross, well now\u2014why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?\n", "Do you two know each other?\n": "No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.\n", "Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?\n": "Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!\n", "Hey you leave Marcel out of this!\n": "Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!\n", "Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!\n": "Monkey lover!\nWhen do you think we lost her?\n", "Monica has a secret closet and she won\u2019t let me see what\u2019s in it.\n": "Why not?\n", "I don\u2019t know! What could she possibly be hiding in here that I can\u2019t see?!\n": "I don\u2019t know. Ooh, I bet it\u2019s Richard.\n", "Why would Monica be keeping Richard in here?\n": "Well off the top of my head uhh, maybe she\u2019s having her cake and eating it too. You being the cake and Richard being the too. Or!\n", "And here we go\u2026\n": "I saw this movie once where there was a door and no one knew what was behind it, and when they finally got it open millions and millions and millions of bugs came pouring out and they feasted on human flesh. Y\u2019know it wouldn\u2019t kill ya to respect your wife\u2019s privacy!  Stupid closet full of bugs!\n", "Joey. Joey, something feels weird and not good weird. I don\u2019t\u2014Whoa!! \n": "Oh hey whoa-whoa, don\u2019t worry. Okay. When my sisters were pregnant they got every weird feeling in the book, it was always nothing.\n", "What? Is it the comet? \n": "No! No-no. Look, there\u2019s a bug stuck in tar right here. \n", "Joey come\u2014I can\u2019t believe\u2014I bring you here to see the Bapstein-King comet, one of nature\u2019s most spectacular phenomenon, and all you care about are bugs stuck in tar and-and some woman!\n": " Y\u2019know, there\u2019s two women dude.\n", "Show me where?\n": "Right-right up here. \n", " Joey where\u2019s the pipe that was holding the door open?\n": " I don\u2019t know!   Yeah, I do.\n", "Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.\n": "Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first\n", "\"Hi Joey, it's Jane Rogers can't wait for your party tonight\" \n": " Stupid Jane Rogers!!\n", " You are having a party tonight??\n": "Kinda have a... a thing for the Days Of Our Life's people.\n", "And you weren't going to tell us? How did you think you were gonna get away with that?\n": "I do it every year.\n", "You do that every year??\n": "I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!\n", "Oh, that's why you got these tickets to that play, to get rid of us??\n": "Yeah...\n", "And last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?\n": "Yeah...\n", "OH! And the year before that, when you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?\n": " I can't believe you guys went for that one!\n", "Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?\n": "You're fine, ok? But everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people!\n", "Well, then so you just invite me...!\n": " Please, I was trying to be nice, you're the worst one!\n", "Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please...\n": "Ok, ok! Fine! You can come, but don't tell anybody else. It's up on the roof at 8.\n", " Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...?  do you...do you guys hear a buzzing? \n Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...?  do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?\n": " Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?\n", " Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.\n": "Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.\n", "I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?\n": "You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!\n", "What? How come that you don't have to go!\n": "I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.\n", " Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.\n": " Hey, here you go.\n", "I\u2019m totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then they\u2019re gonna go to their cast parties and he\u2019s gonna try to undermine me. Y'know it\u2019ll be like, \"So where\u2019s your boyfriend, what\u2019s-his-name, Chester?\" And she\u2019ll go, \"No-no-no, it\u2019s Chandler.\" And he\u2019ll go, \"Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!\"\n": " That-that is a good trick.\n", "All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?\n": "Chandler, look they\u2019re actors. They\u2019re there to do a job, just \u2018cause they work together, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gonna get together. I mean just \u2018cause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gonna happen with them.\n", "Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.\n": "Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. \n", "Oh-okay, I get the game now.\n": "Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?\n", "Oh yeah!\n": "Well okay, so then you\u2019re fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as it\u2019s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. It\u2019s when the heat goes away, that\u2019s when you\u2019re in trouble.\n", "Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here. \n": "Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Thank you Chandler.\n", "So he has to be a male who has at least $50.\n": "Ooh! So close.\n", "Yeah. In fact, I like her so much you tell her I want my cookies early this year! Y\u2019know, a box of Thin Mints and some Tag-a-Longs.\n": "Hey-hey come on you guys, give him a break. Ross, seriously, how\u2019s it going with her?\n", "So Rachel\u2019s all moved out huh? How are you taking it?\n": "Well uh, I wanted to have a few beers, but uh, I got rid of those because Rachel couldn\u2019t stand the smell of them. But I have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though. And uh, it\u2019s a couple weeks past it\u2019s expiration date, so it\u2019s got a bit of a kick.\n", "Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.\n": " Hey, the fight\u2019s starting!\n", "Oh, I can\u2019t watch this. \n": "Check it out, he\u2019s winning!  Pete\u2019s winning!\n", "Ehh?\n": " Oh, and then Monica joked that she wouldn\u2019t go out with a guy like Chandler...\n", "  Hi there. \n": " ...and he couldn\u2019t let it go, and... I don\u2019t really know what happened with that either. \n Oh-oh! And then Ross\u2019s new girlfriend, Bonnie, shows up and Rachel convinced her to save her head. And then Ross and Rachel kiss, and now Ross has to choose between Rachel and the bald girl and I don\u2019t know what happened there either... \n", "Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don\u2019t give out fake names.\n": "Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.\n", " Hey! Is Ross still here?\n": "Uh no Rach, he\u2019s gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.\n", "Clearly you don\u2019t want people to see this tape. Now I don\u2019t want people to see this tape either, but you so badly don\u2019t people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?\n": " Are we watchin\u2019 the tape or not?!\n", "You could get arrested, right now!  All right, yeah, I gotta take it back. I'm totally drunk with power. \n Hey.\n": " Hey!  Oh.\n", "Hi, Joe.\n": "Yeah, I didn\u2019t know you guys were going to be here.\n", "Hey Joey, sweetie, taste this. \n": " What?! Why?!\n", "What is going on with you?\n": "Nothing!\n", "Oh, come on! You've been acting strange all day!\n": "All right! There is something. I kinda had a dream,  but I don't want to talk about it. \n", "Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-what-what if Martin Luther King had said that?  I kinda have a dream! I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\n": "Well, it involved Monica.\n", "You had a dream about a girl that I am seeing?! Oh, that is so cool!  I can't tell you how many times I've dreamt about a girl that he was seeing.   Anyway we're talking about your dream.  I love you.  Your dream? \n": "Don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it or anything. I haven't dreamt about her like that since I found out about you two--ish. \n", "What was the dream about?\n": "Well, okay. You were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle. Y'know like you guys were doing last night. So, that's it. I'm in love with Monica and I'll be moving out.\n", "Wait, Joey! Joey! That doesn\u2019t mean that-that you're in love with me!\n": "It-it doesn\u2019t?\n", "No, it can mean anything. Like uh, all of the sudden you're jealous because I've become the apartment stud.\n": "That kinda sounds like your dream dude.\n", "Or, it could mean that-that you saw Chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too.\n": "In the dream I did enjoy the closeness.\n", "Joey, look, are you attracted to Monica? Right here, right now, are you attracted to her?\n": " Not really.\n", "Well sure! I'm just wearing sweats!  But that's good that you're not in love with me, because you just want a girlfriend!\n": "No, I don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend. Y'know? I mean, yeah, I can get a girlfriend!

Rachel is mean!\n", "Look Joey, I\u2019m sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.\n": "Does a good teacher say, \"Put down the beer pinhead!?\"\n", "Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?\n": "Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?\n", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t want you to get hit by the boom!\n": "Well it hit me anyway!

It's just so grown up.\n": "I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person   named Wiener, God that kills me. \n", "Look at you all grown up.\n": "Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with   Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship.   You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks   aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.\n", "You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you   set me up with someone, and we double date!\n": "I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?\n", "Done. Oh good, really?\n": "Yeah! \n", "Let's see!  Oh, you know   who's great? Sandy Poophack. \n": " Poophack... \n", "Yeah...

Rachel and I hired a male nanny.\n": " Really...? Guys do that...? That's...    weird...\n", "Yes... What is the end of that sentence?\n": "Uhm... A penis model.  Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler    that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?\n", "Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...?    Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...\n": "So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing...    You know, like Ross's thing is... \n", "Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?\n": "...No... \n", "I can't believe he's that upset about this...\n": "Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay.    'Cause he's feeling like... \n", "Did you tell her what we talked about? \n": "Yeah....\n", "Hey...

Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.\n", "Y\u2019know sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren\u2019t they?\n": "Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Y\u2019know? The only problem is, Carl\u2019s acting is\u2026 \n", "The only problem!\n": "Yeah, he\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.\n", "Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.\n": " He\u2019s not really my type.\n", "No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what\u2019s he like. People tell doctors everything.\n": "But you said he was this great guy!\n", " Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.\n": "Hi!\n", "Okay, uh well, let's try one. Whenever you guys are ready. \n": "Uh-oh.\n", "Is there a problem?\n": "Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem.

That\u2019s great! How did you guys meet?\n", "Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way  which uh, which was misleading. Well I\u2019m\u2026  Hello.\n": "Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? \u2018Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would\u2019ve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that\u2019s just for ugly people.\n", "What size shoes do you wear?\n": "Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.\n", "Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?\n": "Uh, I don\u2019t even really know where I left those. Sorry.\n", " Those aren\u2019t eleven and a half.\n": "Okay fine! I\u2019m a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I\u2019ll show ya!\n", "That tape was never meant to be seen by...     Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.  \n": " Monica, look... I don't think you and I have    any secrets anymore...

How you doin'?\n", "Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!\n": "The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin\u2019 Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn\u2019t even get half a cup! Nothin\u2019!!\n", "Oh man!!\n": "And he never played before either! Y\u2019know what I think? I think beginner\u2019s luck, very important in Cups.\n", "All right, let\u2019s play one more hand! One more!\n": "No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I\u2019m serious this time! In-in fact, look, there\u2019s a\u2014I wanna give you something.

You love it!\n": "It\u2019s him, not it!\n", "No, but wait\u2014what if I bought it from you, y\u2019know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say  $1,500?\n": "Wait a second, I see what you\u2019re trying to do here! You-you\u2019re trying to give me money again!\n", "When did I try to give you money?\n": "Over there!  Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said \"No,\" you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!\n", "That\u2019ll be a neat trick, when you\u2019re,  when you\u2019re dead!\n": "Ross, you don\u2019t have to yell.\n", "Oh my God. I mean\u2026\n": "Y\u2019know what? I think that\u2019s enough for today. Thanks for your help! \n", "Oh, wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself.\n": " Hey guys!\n", "Oh that\u2019s right. It\u2019s your first day!

Okay, now much have you won so far?\n": "Uh,  wow, 700.\n", "Not 700 exactly?\n": "Yeah.\n", "Double it! \n": "What?\n", "Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.\n": "Really?\n", "Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.\n": " Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. \n", " Oh that\u2019s great! Good for you.\n": "Hey-hey listen\u2026 \n", "Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm\u2026  Can you hold for one second please?  What?!\n": "When you\u2019re off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?\n", " Hi! I\u2019m back.  Yeah, that sounds great.  Okay. Well, we\u2019ll do it then.  Okay, bye-bye. \n": "Hey listen, so when\u2019s-when\u2019s my audition?

Since I\u2019m here, I think I\u2019m gonna have me a little beer on the port side. \n", "Okay Joey, we\u2019re luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? \n": "Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didn\u2019t know there.\n", "Joey, come on! We just went over this! \n": "Oh, y\u2019know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!\n", " No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!\n": "All right that\u2019s it! You\u2019re yelling and I don\u2019t see you taking your top off! I quit!\n", "What do you mean you quit?! You can\u2019t quit!\n": "Why not?!\n", "Because you\u2019re not finished yet and I won\u2019t have it! Greens do not quit!\n": "Greens? I\u2019m a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!\n", "Oh my God, wait did I\u2014I just said Greens don\u2019t quit didn\u2019t I?   Did I just say Greens don\u2019t quit?!\n": "Yes! Yes! You did and you\u2019re still yelling at me!\n", "No! No! No! I\u2019m not yelling at you, I\u2019m just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh I\u2019m my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! I\u2019ve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this comin\u2019. Oh, Joey, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.\n": "Well, hey I did learn.\n", "Awww\u2026\n": "Yeah, it\u2019s okay. I know what a mainsail is.  I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across.

Why not?\n": "Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone. \n", "No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.\n": "Ross, you're mayor of the zone.\n", "I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...\n": "Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.\n", "I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?\n": "Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' \n", "Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?\n": " Rachel\u2019s having her baby!!  Which is of no interest to me, I\u2019m a neurologist.\n", "I don\u2019t believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?\n": "Fake? Excuse me?

We're going to by hamsters.\n", "No, I don\u2019t want to hit you.\n": "Oh what then? Kick me?\n", "No, no I don\u2019t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I\u2019m not mad at you and\u2026and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that. \n": "Oh now\u2014Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?\n", "Uh\u2026yeah sure. \n": "Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don\u2019t\u2026\n", "What?!

What do I do?\n", "I think you need to tell her how you feel.\n": "Okay that\u2019s the green stuff talkin\u2019.\n", "No, I\u2019m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she\u2019s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.\n": "But what if uh\u2014and I\u2019m not saying she will be\u2014But\u2026\n", "If she is where you are then uh\u2026then my feeling weird about it shouldn\u2019t stand in the way.\n": "Are you sure?\n", "Yeah. Look if-if she\u2019s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn\u2019t find a better guy. So\u2026\n": "Hey thanks.\n", "So when do you think you\u2019re gonna talk to her?\n": "Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven\u2019t even thought about what I will say. What should I say?\n", "I\u2019m understanding, but let\u2019s not get carried away.\n": "I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re right. What am I gonna say?  Oh!\n", "Isn't that Ross's money?\n": "Yeah. Okay. Ross's treat! Where do you wanna eat?\n", "I don't know.\n": "Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!\n", "Too dry.\n": "Do you believe in ghosts, yes or no?\n", "I also said, \"Yes!\"\n": "You don't think this is going to be a big break for me?\n", "No!  Ahhh!!!\n": "I don't believe this!\n", "Look Joe, I just, I just don't want to get your hopes up real high.\n": "What are you talking about?! I'm the lead in a movie!\n", "They're not even paying ya! This doesn't even sound like a real movie!\n": "Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.\n", "Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.\n": "Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.\n", "Oh, you don't want me on the trip?\n": "Not if you're gonna be like this!\n", "All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.\n": "Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!\n", "All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!\n": "Fine!  Get out!\n", "You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.\n": "Get out!!\n", "Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!\n": "Yeah, I didn't know that.\n", "I can\u2019t help you Joey.\n": "Wait!

I mean\u2026 But-but I assure you I will figure it out.\n": "Doesn\u2019t seem like it's going to work, I mean\u2026\n", " Hi, guys!\n": "Hi!\n", "We're flipping Monica's mattress.\n": "So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.\n", "Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?\n": " Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.\n", "Condoms?\n": "You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.\n", "OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker.\n": "Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.\n", "Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.\n": "Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.\n", "'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say \"When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?\"\n": "That makes more sense.\n", "So, what's going on now?\n": "I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!  I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. \n", "Whaddya see?\n": "Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!\n", "Ross! Janice?!\n": "All right, hold on! Hold on. Hold on. This is Ross, okay? He's our friend. He obviously went crazy. He obviously lost his mind.\n", "So are you actually gonna see her again?\n": "Phoebe! Don't put ideas in his head!\n", "Janice\u2019s birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.\n": "Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa.

Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!  \n": " Wow! Didn\u2019t know that.\n", "No-no, wait! There's got to be a better explanation. You can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class.\n": "Yeah, I like that. But no-no, how does that explain why Rachel found my underwear at your place?\n", "Oh\u2014I don't know.\n": "Well, get ready to come out of the non-gay closet!\n", "Great!

I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.\n", "Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I\u2019ll stop seeing her?\n": "Look, it\u2019s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don\u2019t want to live with some one who doesn\u2019t know what it is to be a friend. So, I\u2019ll see ya. \n", "Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!\n": "Yeah! You did!

My experience: if a girl says yes    to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...\n", "Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.\n": " What? Whoo... What?\n", "Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is...    Please?\n": "All right, fine...
